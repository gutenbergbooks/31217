<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Stowe had early and very practical acquaintance
with the art of housekeeping. It strikes one at first as a
little incongruous that an author who devoted her great
powers to stirring the conscience of a nation should from
time to time, and at one period especially, give her mind
to the ordering of family life, but a moment&rsquo;s consideration
will show that the same woman was earnestly at the bottom
of each effort. In a letter to the late Lord Denman, written
in 1853, Mrs. Stowe, speaking of <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>, said:
&ldquo;I wrote what I did because, as a woman, as a mother, I
was oppressed and heartbroken with the sorrows and injustice
which I saw, and because, as a Christian, I felt the
dishonor to Christianity.&rdquo; Not under the stress of passionate
emotion, yet largely from a sense of real responsibility
as a woman, a mother, and a Christian, she occupied
herself with those concerns of every-day life which so distinctly
appeal to a woman&rsquo;s mind. How to order a household,
how to administer that little kingdom over which a
woman rules, and, above all, how to make family life stable,
pure, and conservative of the highest happiness, these were
the questions which she asked herself constantly, and which
she tried to solve, not only incidentally in her fiction, but
directly in her essays, and in that field of one tenth fiction
and nine tenths didacticism, which constitutes most of the
present volume.</p>
<p><i>A Scholar&rsquo;s Adventures in the Country</i> and <i>Trials of a
Housekeeper</i> appeared in the miscellany to which she gave
the name of <i>The Mayflower</i>, and reflect humorously the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
Cincinnati experiences which again are playfully recounted
in letters published in her son&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>. The former, contributed
in 1850 to <i>The National Era</i>, was drawn pretty
closely from the experiments of Professor Stowe. It is
noticeable that in this paper and in <i>Our Second Girl</i>,
which was contributed to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> for January,
1868, the author poses as the masculine member of
the household, as if this assumption gave her some advantage
in the point of view. At any rate, she adopted the
same rôle when she came more deliberately to survey a wide
field in a series of articles.</p>
<p><i>The House</i> and <i>Home Papers</i> were contributed first to
<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, and afterward published in book
form as the production of one Christopher Crowfield,
though there was not the slightest attempt otherwise at
disguising the authorship. The immediate occasion of the
papers was no doubt the removal of the Stowes from
Andover and their establishment in Hartford, an event
which took place shortly before the papers began to appear
in <i>The Atlantic</i>. The years which followed during the
first Hartford residence saw also a marriage in the family
and new problems of daily life constantly presenting themselves,
so that a similar series appeared in the same magazine,
purporting to be from the same householder, entitled
<i>The Chimney Corner</i>. This series, indeed, entered rather
more seriously into questions of social morality, and deepened
in feeling as it proceeded. The eleventh section is a
warm appreciation of the woman who figured so largely in
Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s early life, and the last two papers rose, as the
reader will see, to the height of national memories. Mrs.
Fields has preserved for us, in her <i>Days with Mrs. Stowe</i>,
a striking record of the mingling of the great and the near
in this writer&rsquo;s mind. The period of which she writes is
that in which <i>The Chimney Corner</i> series was drawing to a
close:&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix' name='page_ix'></a>ix</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In the autumn of 1864 she wrote: &lsquo;I feel I need to
write in these days, to keep me from thinking of things that
make me dizzy and blind, and fill my eyes with tears, so
that I cannot see the paper. I mean such things as are
being done where our heroes are dying as Shaw died. It
is not wise that all our literature should run in a rut cut
through our hearts and red with our blood. I feel the
need of a little gentle household merriment and talk of
common things, to indulge which I have devised the following.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding her view of the need, and her skillfully
devised plans to meet it, she soon sent another epistle,
showing how impossible it was to stem the current of her
thought:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='sig3'>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>November 29, 1864.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class='smcap'>My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have sent my New Year&rsquo;s article, the result of one of
those peculiar experiences which sometimes occur to us
writers. I had planned an article, gay, sprightly, wholly
domestic; but as I began and sketched the pleasant home
and quiet fireside, an irresistible impulse <i>wrote for me</i> what
followed,&mdash;an offering of sympathy to the suffering and
agonized, whose homes have forever been darkened. Many
causes united at once to force on me this vision, from which
generally I shrink, but which sometimes will not be denied,&mdash;will
make itself felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just before I went to New York two of my earliest and
most intimate friends lost their oldest sons, captains and
majors,&mdash;splendid fellows physically and morally, beautiful,
brave, religious, uniting the courage of soldiers to the faith of
martyrs,&mdash;and when I went to Brooklyn it seemed as if I were
hearing some such thing almost every day; and Henry, in his
profession as minister, has so many letters full of imploring
anguish, the cry of hearts breaking that ask help of him.&rsquo;&rdquo;...</p>

<h3>I <br /><br />THE RAVAGES OF A CARPET</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s so cheap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were spoken by my wife, as she sat gracefully
on a roll of Brussels carpet which was spread out in
flowery lengths on the floor of Messrs. Ketchem &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>so</i> cheap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milton says that the love of fame is the last infirmity of
noble minds. I think he had not rightly considered the
subject. I believe that last infirmity is the love of getting
things cheap! Understand me, now. I don&rsquo;t mean the
love of getting cheap things, by which one understands
showy, trashy, ill-made, spurious articles, bearing certain
apparent resemblances to better things. All really sensible
people are quite superior to that sort of cheapness. But
those fortunate accidents, which put within the power of a
man things really good and valuable for half or a third of
their value, what mortal virtue and resolution can withstand?
My friend Brown has a genuine Murillo, the joy
of his heart and the light of his eyes, but he never fails to
tell you, as its crowning merit, how he bought it in South
America for just nothing,&mdash;how it hung smoky and
deserted in the back of a counting-room, and was thrown in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
as a makeweight to bind a bargain, and, upon being cleaned
turned out a genuine Murillo; and then he takes out his
cigar, and calls your attention to the points in it; he adjusts
the curtain to let the sunlight fall just in the right spot;
he takes you to this and the other point of view; and all
this time you must confess that, in your mind as well as
his, the consideration that he got all this beauty for ten
dollars adds lustre to the painting. Brown has paintings
there for which he paid his thousands, and, being well
advised, they are worth the thousands he paid; but this
ewe lamb that he got for nothing always gives him a secret
exaltation in his own eyes. He seems to have credited to
himself personally merit to the amount of what he should
have paid for the picture. Then there is Mrs. Cr&oelig;sus, at
the party yesterday evening, expatiating to my wife on the
surprising cheapness of her point-lace set. &ldquo;Got for just
nothing at all, my dear!&rdquo; and a circle of admiring listeners
echoes the sound. &ldquo;Did you ever hear anything like it?
I never heard of such a thing in my life;&rdquo; and away sails
Mrs. Cr&oelig;sus as if she had a collar composed of all the cardinal
virtues. In fact, she is buoyed up with a secret sense
of merit, so that her satin slippers scarcely touch the carpet.
Even I myself am fond of showing a first edition of &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; for which I gave a shilling in a London bookstall,
and stating that I would not take a hundred dollars
for it. Even I must confess there are points on which I
am mortal.</p>
<p>But all this while my wife sits on her roll of carpet,
looking into my face for approbation, and Marianne and
Jenny are pouring into my ear a running fire of &ldquo;How
sweet! How lovely! Just like that one of Mrs. Tweedleum&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she gave two dollars and seventy-five cents a yard
for hers, and this is&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>My wife here put her hand to her mouth and pronounced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
the incredible sum in a whisper, with a species of sacred
awe, common, as I have observed, to females in such interesting
crises. In fact Mr. Ketchem, standing smiling and
amiable by, remarked to me that really he hoped Mrs. Crowfield
would not name generally what she gave for the article,
for positively it was so far below the usual rate of
prices that he might give offense to other customers; but
this was the very last of the pattern, and they were anxious
to close off the old stock, and we had always traded with
them, and he had a great respect for my wife&rsquo;s father, who
had always traded with their firm, and so, when there were
any little bargains to be thrown in any one&rsquo;s way, why,
he naturally, of course&mdash;And here Mr. Ketchem bowed
gracefully over the yardstick to my wife, and I consented.</p>
<p>Yes, I consented; but whenever I think of myself at
that moment, I always am reminded, in a small way, of
Adam taking the apple; and my wife, seated on that roll
of carpet, has more than once suggested to my mind the
classic image of Pandora opening her unlucky box. In
fact, from the moment I had blandly assented to Mr.
Ketchem&rsquo;s remarks, and said to my wife, with a gentle air
of dignity, &ldquo;Well, my dear, since it suits you, I think you
had better take it,&rdquo; there came a load on my prophetic
soul which not all the fluttering and chattering of my
delighted girls and the more placid complacency of my
wife could entirely dissipate. I presaged I know not what
of coming woe, and all I presaged came to pass.</p>
<p>In order to know just what came to pass, I must give
you a view of the house and home into which this carpet
was introduced.</p>
<p>My wife and I were somewhat advanced housekeepers,
and our dwelling was first furnished by her father, in the
old-fashioned jog-trot days when furniture was made with
a view to its lasting from generation to generation. Everything
was strong and comfortable,&mdash;heavy mahogany,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
guiltless of the modern device of veneering, and hewed out
with a square solidity which had not an idea of change. It
was, so to speak, a sort of granite foundation of the household
structure. Then we commenced housekeeping with
the full idea that our house was a thing to be lived in, and
that furniture was made to be used. That most sensible
of women, Mrs. Crowfield, agreed fully with me that in
our house there was to be nothing too good for ourselves,&mdash;no
room shut up in holiday attire to be enjoyed by strangers
for three or four days in the year, while we lived in holes
and corners; no best parlor from which we were to be
excluded; no silver plate to be kept in the safe in the
bank, and brought home only in case of a grand festival,
while our daily meals were served with dingy Britannia.
&ldquo;Strike a broad, plain average,&rdquo; I said to my wife; &ldquo;have
everything abundant, serviceable, and give all our friends
exactly what we have ourselves, no better and no worse;&rdquo;
and my wife smiled approval on my sentiment.</p>
<p>Smile? she did more than smile. My wife resembles one
of those convex mirrors I have sometimes seen. Every idea
I threw out, plain and simple, she reflected back upon me
in a thousand little glitters and twinkles of her own; she
made my crude conceptions come back to me in such perfectly
dazzling performances that I hardly recognized them.
My mind warms up when I think what a home that woman
made of our house from the very first day she moved
into it. The great, large, airy parlor, with its ample bow-window,
when she had arranged it, seemed a perfect trap to
catch sunbeams. There was none of that discouraging trimness
and newness that often repel a man&rsquo;s bachelor friends
after the first call, and make them feel, &ldquo;Oh, well, one
cannot go in at Crowfield&rsquo;s now, unless one is dressed; one
might put them out.&rdquo; The first thing our parlor said to
any one was, that we were not people to be put out, that we
were widespread, easy-going, and jolly folk. Even if Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Brown brought in Ponto and his shooting-bag, there was
nothing in that parlor to strike terror into man and dog;
for it was written on the face of things that everybody
there was to do just as he or she pleased. There were my
books and my writing-table spread out with all its miscellaneous
confusion of papers on one side of the fireplace, and
there were my wife&rsquo;s great, ample sofa and work-table on
the other; there I wrote my articles for the &ldquo;North American;&rdquo;
and there she turned and ripped and altered her
dresses; and there lay crochet and knitting and embroidery
side by side with a weekly basket of family mending, and
in neighborly contiguity with the last book of the season,
which my wife turned over as she took her after-dinner
lounge on the sofa. And in the bow-window were canaries
always singing, and a great stand of plants always fresh and
blooming, and ivy which grew and clambered and twined
about the pictures. Best of all, there was in our parlor
that household altar, the blazing wood fire, whose wholesome,
hearty crackle is the truest household inspiration. I
quite agree with one celebrated American author who holds
that an open fireplace is an altar of patriotism. Would our
Revolutionary fathers have gone barefooted and bleeding
over snows to defend air-tight stoves and cooking-ranges?
I trow not. It was the memory of the great open kitchen-fire,
with its back log and fore stick of cord-wood, its roaring,
hilarious voice of invitation, its dancing tongues of flame,
that called to them through the snows of that dreadful
winter to keep up their courage, that made their hearts
warm and bright with a thousand reflected memories. Our
neighbors said that it was delightful to sit by our fire,&mdash;but
then, for their part, they could not afford it, wood was
so ruinously dear, and all that. Most of these people could
not, for the simple reason that they felt compelled, in order
to maintain the family dignity, to keep up a parlor with
great pomp and circumstance of upholstery, where they sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
only on dress occasions, and of course the wood fire was out
of the question.</p>
<p>When children began to make their appearance in our
establishment, my wife, like a well-conducted housekeeper,
had the best of nursery arrangements,&mdash;a room all warmed,
lighted, and ventilated, and abounding in every proper
resource of amusement to the rising race; but it was
astonishing to see how, notwithstanding this, the centripetal
attraction drew every pair of little pattering feet to our
parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, why don&rsquo;t you take your blocks upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be where oo are,&rdquo; said with a piteous under
lip, was generally a most convincing answer.</p>
<p>Then, the small people could not be disabused of the idea
that certain chief treasures of their own would be safer
under papa&rsquo;s writing-table or mamma&rsquo;s sofa than in the
safest closet of their domains. My writing-table was dockyard
for Arthur&rsquo;s new ship, and stable for little Tom&rsquo;s
pepper-and-salt-colored pony, and carriage-house for Charley&rsquo;s
new wagon, while whole armies of paper dolls kept house in
the recess behind mamma&rsquo;s sofa.</p>
<p>And then, in due time, came the tribe of pets who
followed the little ones and rejoiced in the blaze of the firelight.
The boys had a splendid Newfoundland, which,
knowing our weakness, we warned them with awful gravity
was never to be a parlor dog; but somehow, what with
little beggings and pleadings on the part of Arthur and Tom,
and the piteous melancholy with which Rover would look
through the window-panes when shut out from the blazing
warmth into the dark, cold veranda, it at last came to pass
that Rover gained a regular corner at the hearth, a regular
status in every family convocation. And then came a little
black-and-tan English terrier for the girls; and then a fleecy
poodle, who established himself on the corner of my wife&rsquo;s
sofa; and for each of these some little voice pleaded, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
some little heart would be so near broken at any slight that
my wife and I resigned ourselves to live in a menagerie, the
more so as we were obliged to confess a lurking weakness
towards these four-footed children ourselves.</p>
<p>So we grew and flourished together,&mdash;children, dogs,
birds, flowers, and all; and although my wife often, in
paroxysms of housewifeliness to which the best of women
are subject, would declare that we never were fit to be
seen, yet I comforted her with the reflection that there
were few people whose friends seemed to consider them
better worth seeing, judging by the stream of visitors and
loungers which was always setting towards our parlor.
People seemed to find it good to be there; they said it was
somehow home-like and pleasant, and that there was a kind
of charm about it that made it easy to talk and easy to
live; and as my girls and boys grew up, there seemed always
to be some merry doing or other going on there.
Arty and Tom brought home their college friends, who
straightway took root there and seemed to fancy themselves
a part of us. We had no reception-rooms apart, where the
girls were to receive young gentlemen; all the courting and
flirting that were to be done had for their arena the ample
variety of surface presented by our parlor, which, with sofas
and screens and lounges and recesses, and writing and work
tables, disposed here and there, and the genuine <i>laisser
aller</i> of the whole mènage, seemed, on the whole, to have
offered ample advantages enough; for at the time I write
of, two daughters were already established in marriage, while
my youngest was busy, as yet, in performing that little
domestic ballet of the cat with the mouse, in the case of a
most submissive youth of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>All this time our parlor furniture, though of that granitic
formation I have indicated, began to show marks of that
decay to which things sublunary are liable. I cannot say
that I dislike this look in a room. Take a fine, ample,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
hospitable apartment, where all things, freely and generously
used, softly and indefinably grow old together, there
is a sort of mellow tone and keeping which pleases my eye.
What if the seams of the great inviting armchair, where so
many friends have sat and lounged, do grow white? What,
in fact, if some easy couch has an undeniable hole worn in
its friendly cover? I regard with tenderness even these
mortal weaknesses of these servants and witnesses of our
good times and social fellowship. No vulgar touch wore
them; they may be called, rather, the marks and indentations
which the glittering in and out of the tide of social
happiness has worn in the rocks of our strand. I would
no more disturb the gradual toning-down and aging of a
well-used set of furniture by smart improvements than I
would have a modern dauber paint in emendations in a fine
old picture.</p>
<p>So we men reason, but women do not always think as
we do. There is a virulent demon of housekeeping not
wholly cast out in the best of them, and which often breaks
out in unguarded moments. In fact Miss Marianne, being
on the lookout for furniture wherewith to begin a new
establishment, and Jenny, who had accompanied her in her
peregrinations, had more than once thrown out little disparaging
remarks on the time-worn appearance of our establishment,
suggesting comparison with those of more modern
furnished rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is positively scandalous, the way our furniture looks,&rdquo;
I one day heard one of them declaring to her mother; &ldquo;and
this old rag of a carpet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My feelings were hurt, not the less so that I knew that
the large cloth which covered the middle of the floor, and
which the women call a bocking, had been bought and
nailed down there, after a solemn family council, as the
best means of concealing the too evident darns which years
of good cheer had made needful in our stanch old household
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
friend, the three-ply carpet, made in those days when
to be a three-ply was a pledge of continuance and service.</p>
<p>Well, it was a joyous and bustling day when, after one
of those domestic whirlwinds which the women are fond of
denominating house-cleaning, the new Brussels carpet was
at length brought in and nailed down, and its beauty
praised from mouth to mouth. Our old friends called in
and admired, and all seemed to be well, except that I had
that light and delicate presage of changes to come which
indefinitely brooded over me.</p>
<p>The first premonitory symptom was the look of apprehensive
suspicion with which the female senate regarded the
genial sunbeams that had always glorified our bow-window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house ought to have inside blinds,&rdquo; said Marianne,
with all the confident decision of youth; &ldquo;this carpet
will be ruined if that sun is allowed to come in like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that dirty little canary must really be hung in the
kitchen,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;he always did make such a litter,
scattering his seed chippings about; and he never takes
his bath without flirting out some water. And, mamma, it
appears to me it will never do to have the plants here.
Plants are always either leaking through the pots upon the
carpet, or scattering bits of blossoms and dead leaves, or
some accident upsets or breaks a pot. It was no matter,
you know, when we had the old carpet; but this we really
want to have kept nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamma stood her ground for the plants,&mdash;darlings of
her heart for many a year,&mdash;but temporized, and showed
that disposition towards compromise which is most inviting
to aggression.</p>
<p>I confess I trembled; for, of all radicals on earth, none
are to be compared to females that have once in hand a
course of domestic innovation and reform. The sacred fire,
the divine furor, burns in their bosoms; they become perfect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Pythonesses, and every chair they sit on assumes the magic
properties of the tripod. Hence the dismay that lodges in
the bosoms of us males at the fateful spring and autumn
seasons denominated house-cleaning. Who can say whither
the awful gods, the prophetic fates, may drive our fair
household divinities; what sins of ours may be brought to
light; what indulgences and compliances, which uninspired
woman has granted in her ordinary mortal hours, may be
torn from us? He who has been allowed to keep a pair of
pet slippers in a concealed corner, and by the fireside indulged
with a chair which he might <i>ad libitum</i> fill with
all sorts of pamphlets and miscellaneous literature, suddenly
finds himself reformed out of knowledge, his pamphlets
tucked away into pigeonholes and corners, and his slippers
put in their place in the hall, with, perhaps, a brisk insinuation
about the shocking dust and disorder that men will
tolerate.</p>
<p>The fact was, that the very first night after the advent
of the new carpet I had a prophetic dream. Among our
treasures of art was a little etching, by an English artist
friend, the subject of which was the gambols of the household
fairies in a baronial library after the household were
in bed. The little people are represented in every attitude
of frolic enjoyment. Some escalade the great armchair,
and look down from its top as from a domestic Mont Blanc;
some climb about the bellows; some scale the shaft of the
shovel; while some, forming in magic ring, dance festively
on the yet glowing hearth. Tiny troops promenade the
writing-table. One perches himself quaintly on the top of
the inkstand, and holds colloquy with another who sits
cross-legged on a paper weight, while a companion looks
down on them from the top of the sandbox. It was an
ingenious little device, and gave me the idea, which I often
expressed to my wife, that much of the peculiar feeling of
security, composure, and enjoyment which seems to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
atmosphere of some rooms and houses came from the unsuspected
presence of these little people, the household fairies,
so that the belief in their existence became a solemn article
of faith with me.</p>
<p>Accordingly, that evening, after the installation of the
carpet, when my wife and daughters had gone to bed, as I
sat with my slippered feet before the last coals of the fire,
I fell asleep in my chair, and, lo! my own parlor presented
to my eye a scene of busy life. The little people in green
were tripping to and fro, but in great confusion. Evidently
something was wrong among them; for they were fussing
and chattering with each other, as if preparatory to a general
movement. In the region of the bow-window I observed a
tribe of them standing with tiny valises and carpetbags in
their hands, as though about to depart on a journey. On
my writing-table another set stood around my inkstand and
pen-rack, who, pointing to those on the floor, seemed to
debate some question among themselves; while others of
them appeared to be collecting and packing away in tiny
trunks certain fairy treasures, preparatory to a general departure.
When I looked at the social hearth, at my wife&rsquo;s
sofa and work-basket, I saw similar appearances of dissatisfaction
and confusion. It was evident that the household
fairies were discussing the question of a general and simultaneous
removal. I groaned in spirit, and, stretching out
my hand, began a conciliatory address, when whisk went
the whole scene from before my eyes, and I awaked to
behold the form of my wife asking me if I were ill, or had
had the nightmare, that I groaned so. I told her my dream,
and we laughed at it together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must give way to the girls a little,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
is natural, you know, that they should wish us to appear a
little as other people do. The fact is, our parlor is somewhat
dilapidated; think how many years we have lived in
it without an article of new furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate new furniture,&rdquo; I remarked, in the bitterness of
my soul. &ldquo;I hate anything new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife answered me discreetly, according to approved
principles of diplomacy. I was right. She sympathized
with me. At the same time, it was not necessary, she
remarked, that we should keep a hole in our sofa-cover and
armchair,&mdash;there would certainly be no harm in sending
them to the upholsterer&rsquo;s to be new-covered; she didn&rsquo;t
much mind, for her part, moving her plants to the south
back room; and the bird would do well enough in the
kitchen: I had often complained of him for singing vociferously
when I was reading aloud.</p>
<p>So our sofa went to the upholsterer&rsquo;s; but the upholsterer
was struck with such horror at its clumsy, antiquated,
unfashionable appearance that he felt bound to make representations
to my wife and daughters: positively, it would
be better for them to get a new one, of a tempting pattern
which he showed them, than to try to do anything with
that. With a stitch or so here and there it might do for a
basement dining-room; but, for a parlor, he gave it as his
disinterested opinion,&mdash;he must say, if the case were his
own, he should get, etc., etc. In short, we had a new sofa
and new chairs, and the plants and the birds were banished,
and some dark-green blinds were put up to exclude the sun
from the parlor, and the blessed luminary was allowed there
only at rare intervals, when my wife and daughters were
out shopping, and I acted out my uncivilized male instincts
by pulling up every shade and vivifying the apartment as
in days of old.</p>
<p>But this was not the worst of it. The new furniture
and new carpet formed an opposition party in the room. I
believe in my heart that for every little household fairy
that went out with the dear old things there came in a tribe
of discontented brownies with the new ones. These little
wretches were always twitching at the gowns of my wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and daughters, jogging their elbows, and suggesting odious
comparisons between the smart new articles and what remained
of the old ones. They disparaged my writing-table
in the corner; they disparaged the old-fashioned lounge in
the other corner, which had been the maternal throne for
years; they disparaged the work-table, the work-basket,
with constant suggestions of how such things as these
would look in certain well-kept parlors where new-fashioned
furniture of the same sort as ours existed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any parlor,&rdquo; said Jenny one day. &ldquo;Our
parlor has always been a sort of log cabin,&mdash;library, study,
nursery, greenhouse, all combined. We never have had
things like other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and this open fire makes such a dust; and this
carpet is one that shows every speck of dust; it keeps one
always on the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why papa never had a study to himself; I&rsquo;m
sure I should think he would like it better than sitting here
among us all. Now there&rsquo;s the great south room off the
dining-room; if he would only move his things there and
have his open fire, we could then close up the fireplace and
put lounges in the recesses, and mamma could have her
things in the nursery,&mdash;and then we should have a parlor
fit to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I overheard all this, though I pretended not to,&mdash;the
little busy chits supposing me entirely buried in the recesses
of a German book over which I was poring.</p>
<p>There are certain crises in a man&rsquo;s life when the female
element in his household asserts itself in dominant forms
that seem to threaten to overwhelm him. The fair creatures,
who in most matters have depended on his judgment,
evidently look upon him at these seasons as only a forlorn,
incapable male creature, to be cajoled and flattered and persuaded
out of his native blindness and absurdity into the
fairyland of their wishes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, mamma,&rdquo; said the busy voices, &ldquo;men can&rsquo;t
understand such things. What can men know of housekeeping,
and how things ought to look? Papa never goes
into company; he don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t care how the world
is doing, and don&rsquo;t see that nobody now is living as we
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, my little mistresses, are you there?&rdquo; I thought;
and I mentally resolved on opposing a great force of what
our politicians call backbone to this pretty domestic conspiracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get my writing-table out of this corner, my
pretty dears, I&rsquo;d thank you to let me know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spake I in my blindness, fool that I was. Jupiter
might as soon keep awake when Juno came in best bib and
tucker, and with the cestus of Venus, to get him to sleep.
Poor Slender might as well hope to get the better of pretty
Mistress Anne Page as one of us clumsy-footed men might
endeavor to escape from the tangled labyrinth of female
wiles.</p>
<p>In short, in less than a year it was all done, without any
quarrel, any noise, any violence,&mdash;done, I scarce knew
when or how, but with the utmost deference to my wishes,
the most amiable hopes that I would not put myself out,
the most sincere protestations that, if I liked it better as it
was, my goddesses would give up and acquiesce. In fact I
seemed to do it of myself, constrained thereto by what the
Emperor Napoleon has so happily called the logic of events,&mdash;that
old, well-known logic by which the man who has
once said A must say B, and he who has said B must say
the whole alphabet. In a year we had a parlor with two
lounges in decorous recesses, a fashionable sofa, and six
chairs and a looking-glass, and a grate always shut up, and
a hole in the floor which kept the parlor warm, and great,
heavy curtains that kept out all the light that was not
already excluded by the green shades.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>It was as proper and orderly a parlor as those of our
most fashionable neighbors; and when our friends called,
we took them stumbling into its darkened solitude, and
opened a faint crack in one of the window-shades, and came
down in our best clothes and talked with them there. Our
old friends rebelled at this, and asked what they had done
to be treated so, and complained so bitterly that gradually
we let them into the secret that there was a great south
room, which I had taken for my study, where we all sat;
where the old carpet was down; where the sun shone in at
the great window; where my wife&rsquo;s plants flourished, and
the canary-bird sang, and my wife had her sofa in the corner,
and the old brass andirons glistened, and the wood fire
crackled,&mdash;in short, a room to which all the household
fairies had emigrated.</p>
<p>When they once had found that out, it was difficult to
get any of them to sit in our parlor. I had purposely
christened the new room my study, that I might stand on
my rights as master of ceremonies there, though I opened
wide arms of welcome to any who chose to come. So, then,
it would often come to pass that, when we were sitting
round the fire in my study of an evening, the girls would
say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, what do we always stay here for? Why don&rsquo;t
we ever sit in the parlor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there would be manifested among guests and
family friends a general unwillingness to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it, girls!&rdquo; would Arthur say; &ldquo;the parlor is
well enough, all right; let it stay as it is, and let a fellow
stay where he can do as he pleases and feels at home;&rdquo; and
to this view of the matter would respond divers of the
nice young bachelors who were Arthur&rsquo;s and Tom&rsquo;s sworn
friends.</p>
<p>In fact nobody wanted to stay in our parlor now. It
was a cold, correct, accomplished fact; the household
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
fairies had left it,&mdash;and when the fairies leave a room, nobody
ever feels at home in it. No pictures, curtains, no
wealth of mirrors, no elegance of lounges, can in the least
make up for their absence. They are a capricious little
set; there are rooms where they will not stay, and rooms
where they will; but no one can ever have a good time
without them.</p>

<h3>II <br /><br />HOMEKEEPING VERSUS HOUSEKEEPING</h3>
</div>
<p>I am a frank-hearted man, as perhaps you have by this
time perceived, and you will not, therefore, be surprised to
know that I read my last article on the carpet to my wife
and the girls before I sent it to the &ldquo;Atlantic,&rdquo; and we had
a hearty laugh over it together. My wife and the girls, in
fact, felt that they could afford to laugh, for they had carried
their point, their reproach among women was taken
away, they had become like other folks. Like other folks
they had a parlor, an undeniable best parlor, shut up and
darkened, with all proper carpets, curtains, lounges, and
marble-topped tables, too good for human nature&rsquo;s daily
food; and being sustained by this consciousness, they cheerfully
went on receiving their friends in the study, and
having good times in the old free-and-easy way; for did
not everybody know that this room was not their best?
and if the furniture was old-fashioned and a little the worse
for antiquity, was it not certain that they had better, which
they could use if they would?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supposing we wanted to give a party,&rdquo; said Jenny,
&ldquo;how nicely our parlor would light up! Not that we ever
do give parties, but if we should,&mdash;and for a wedding-reception,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt the force of the necessity; it was evident that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
four or five hundred extra which we had expended was no
more than such solemn possibilities required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, papa thinks we have been foolish,&rdquo; said Marianne,
&ldquo;and he has his own way of making a good story of
it; but, after all, I desire to know if people are never to
get a new carpet. Must we keep the old one till it actually
wears to tatters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a specimen of the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> which
our fair antagonists of the other sex are fond of employing.
They strip what we say of all delicate shadings and illusory
phrases, and reduce it to some bare question of fact, with
which they make a home-thrust at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it; are people <i>never</i> to get a new carpet?&rdquo;
echoed Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it is a fact that to introduce
anything new into an apartment hallowed by many home
associations, where all things have grown old together,
requires as much care and adroitness as for an architect to
restore an arch or niche in a fine old ruin. The fault of our
carpet was that it was in another style from everything
in our room, and made everything in it look dilapidated.
Its colors, material, and air belonged to another manner of
life, and were a constant plea for alterations; and you see
it actually drove out and expelled the whole furniture of
the room, and I am not sure yet that it may not entail
on us the necessity of refurnishing the whole house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said my wife, in a tone of remonstrance;
but Jane and Marianne laughed and colored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confess, now,&rdquo; said I, looking at them; &ldquo;have you not
had secret designs on the hall and stair carpet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, papa, how could you know it? I only said to
Marianne that to have Brussels in the parlor and that old
mean-looking ingrain carpet in the hall did not seem exactly
the thing; and in fact you know, mamma, Messrs.
Ketchem &amp; Co. showed us such a lovely pattern, designed
to harmonize with our parlor carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, girls,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;but you know I said
at once that such an expense was not to be thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, girls,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let me tell you a story I heard
once of a very sensible old New England minister, who
lived, as our country ministers generally do, rather near to
the bone, but still quite contentedly. It was in the days
when knee-breeches and long stockings were worn, and
this good man was offered a present of a very nice pair of
black silk hose. He declined, saying he &lsquo;could not afford
to wear them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not afford it?&rsquo; said the friend; &lsquo;why, I <i>give</i> them to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Exactly; but it will cost me not less than two hundred
dollars to take them, and I cannot do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, in the first place, I shall no sooner put them on
than my wife will say, &ldquo;My dear, you must have a new
pair of knee-breeches,&rdquo; and I shall get them. Then my
wife will say, &ldquo;My dear, how shabby your coat is! You
must have a new one,&rdquo; and I shall get a new coat. Then
she will say, &ldquo;Now, my dear, that hat will never do,&rdquo; and
then I shall have a new hat; and then I shall say, &ldquo;My
dear, it will never do for me to be so fine and you to wear
your old gown,&rdquo; and so my wife will get a new gown; and
then the new gown will require a new shawl and a new
bonnet; all of which we shall not feel the need of if I don&rsquo;t
take this pair of silk stockings, for, as long as we don&rsquo;t see
them, our old things seem very well suited to each other.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed at this story, and I then added, in my
most determined manner,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must warn you, girls, that I have compromised
to the utmost extent of my power, and that I intend to
plant myself on the old stair carpet in determined resistance.
I have no mind to be forbidden the use of the front stairs,
or condemned to get up into my bedroom by a private ladder,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
as I should be immediately if there were a new carpet
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be so? Can the sun shine in the parlor
now for fear of fading the carpet? Can we keep a fire
there for fear of making dust, or use the lounges and sofas
for fear of wearing them out? If you got a new entry and
stair carpet, as I said, I should have to be at the expense of
another staircase to get up to our bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, papa,&rdquo; said Jane innocently; &ldquo;there are very
pretty druggets now for covering stair carpets, so that they
can be used without hurting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put one over the old carpet, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and our
acquaintance will never know but it is a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the female senate laughed at this proposal, and said
it sounded just like a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, standing up resolutely for my sex, &ldquo;a
man&rsquo;s ideas on woman&rsquo;s matters may be worth some attention.
I flatter myself that an intelligent, educated man
doesn&rsquo;t think upon and observe with interest any particular
subject for years of his life without gaining some ideas respecting
it that are good for something; at all events, I
have written another article for the &lsquo;Atlantic,&rsquo; which I will
read to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wait one minute, papa, till we get our work,&rdquo;
said the girls, who, to say the truth, always exhibit a flattering
interest in anything their papa writes, and who have
the good taste never to interrupt his readings with any conversations
in an undertone on cross-stitch and floss-silks, as
the manner of some is. Hence the little feminine bustle of
arranging all these matters beforehand. Jane, or Jenny, as
I call her in my good-natured moods, put on a fresh clear
stick of hickory, of that species denominated shagbark,
which is full of most charming slivers, burning with such a
clear flame, and emitting such a delicious perfume in burning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
that I would not change it with the millionaire who
kept up his fire with cinnamon.</p>
<p>You must know, my dear Mr. Atlantic, and you, my
confidential friends of the reading public, that there is a
certain magic or spiritualism which I have the knack of in
regard to these mine articles, in virtue of which my wife
and daughters never hear or see the little personalities
respecting them which form parts of my papers. By a
peculiar arrangement which I have made with the elves of
the inkstand and the familiar spirits of the quill, a sort of
glamour falls on their eyes and ears when I am reading, or
when they read the parts personal to themselves; otherwise
their sense of feminine propriety would be shocked at
the free way in which they and their most internal affairs
are confidentially spoken of between me and you, O loving
readers.</p>
<p>Thus, in an undertone, I tell you that my little Jenny,
as she is zealously and systematically arranging the fire, and
trimly whisking every untidy particle of ashes from the
hearth, shows in every movement of her little hands, in the
cock of her head, in the knowing, observing glance of her
eye, and in all her energetic movements, that her small
person is endued and made up of the very expressed essence
of housewifeliness,&mdash;she is the very attar, not of roses, but
of housekeeping. Care-taking and thrift and neatness are a
nature to her; she is as dainty and delicate in her person
as a white cat, as everlastingly busy as a bee; and all the
most needful faculties of time, weight, measure, and proportion
ought to be fully developed in her skull, if there is
any truth in phrenology. Besides all this, she has a sort
of hard-grained little vein of common sense, against which
my fanciful conceptions and poetical notions are apt to hit
with just a little sharp grating, if they are not well put.
In fact, this kind of woman needs carefully to be idealized
in the process of education, or she will stiffen and dry, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
she grows old, into a veritable household Pharisee, a sort of
domestic tyrant. She needs to be trained in artistic values
and artistic weights and measures, to study all the arts and
sciences of the beautiful, and then she is charming. Most
useful, most needful, these little women: they have the
centripetal force which keeps all the domestic planets from
gyrating and frisking in unseemly orbits, and, properly
trained, they fill a house with the beauty of order, the harmony
and consistency of proportion, the melody of things
moving in time and tune, without violating the graceful
appearance of ease which Art requires.</p>
<p>So I had an eye to Jenny&rsquo;s education in my article which
I unfolded and read, and which was entitled</p>
<h4>HOMEKEEPING VERSUS HOUSEKEEPING</h4>
<p>There are many women who know how to keep a house,
but there are but few that know how to keep a home. To
keep a house may seem a complicated affair, but it is a thing
that may be learned; it lies in the region of the material;
in the region of weight, measure, color, and the positive
forces of life. To keep a home lies not merely in the
sphere of all these, but it takes in the intellectual, the
social, the spiritual, the immortal.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Here the hickory stick broke in two, and the two brands
fell controversially out and apart on the hearth, scattering
the ashes and coals, and calling for Jenny and the hearth-brush.
Your wood fire has this foible, that it needs something
to be done to it every five minutes; but, after all,
these little interruptions of our bright-faced genius are like
the piquant sallies of a clever friend,&mdash;they do not strike
us as unreasonable.</p>
<p>When Jenny had laid down her brush she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, papa, you are beginning to soar into
metaphysics.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in creation is metaphysical in its abstract
terms,&rdquo; said I, with a look calculated to reduce her to a
respectful condition. &ldquo;Everything has a subjective and an
objective mode of presentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There papa goes with subjective and objective!&rdquo; said
Marianne. &ldquo;For my part, I never can remember which is
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s what our old nurse
used to call internal and <i>out</i>-ternal,&mdash;I always remember
by that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dears,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;let your father read;&rdquo;
so I went on as follows:&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>I remember in my bachelor days going with my boon
companion, Bill Carberry, to look at the house to which he
was in a few weeks to introduce his bride. Bill was a gallant,
free-hearted, open-handed fellow, the life of our whole
set, and we felt that natural aversion to losing him that
bachelor friends would. How could we tell under what
strange aspects he might look forth upon us, when once
he had passed into &ldquo;that undiscovered country&rdquo; of matrimony?
But Bill laughed to scorn our apprehensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Chris,&rdquo; he said, as he sprang cheerily
up the steps and unlocked the door of his future dwelling,
&ldquo;do you know what I chose this house for? Because
it&rsquo;s a social-looking house. Look there, now,&rdquo; he said, as
he ushered me into a pair of parlors,&mdash;&ldquo;look at those long
south windows, the sun lies there nearly all day long; see
what a capital corner there is for a lounging-chair; fancy
us, Chris, with our books or our paper, spread out loose
and easy, and Sophie gliding in and out like a sunbeam.
I&rsquo;m getting poetical, you see. Then, did you ever see a
better, wider, airier dining-room? What capital suppers
and things we&rsquo;ll have there! the nicest times,&mdash;everything
free and easy, you know,&mdash;just what I&rsquo;ve always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
wanted a house for. I tell you, Chris, you and Tom Innis
shall have latch-keys just like mine, and there is a capital
chamber there at the head of the stairs, so that you can be
free to come and go. And here now&rsquo;s the library,&mdash;fancy
this full of books and engravings from the ceiling to the
floor; here you shall come just as you please and ask no
questions,&mdash;all the same as if it were your own, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sophie, what will she say to all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know Sophie is a prime friend to both of you,
and a capital girl to keep things going. Oh, Sophie&rsquo;ll make
a house of this, you may depend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A day or two after, Bill dragged me stumbling over boxes
and through straw and wrappings to show me the glories of
the parlor furniture, with which he seemed pleased as a child
with a new toy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;see these chairs, garnet-colored
satin, with a pattern on each; well, the sofa&rsquo;s just like them,
and the curtains to match, and the carpets made for the
floor with centrepieces and borders. I never saw anything
more magnificent in my life. Sophie&rsquo;s governor furnishes
the house, and everything is to be A No. 1, and all that,
you see. Messrs. Curtain &amp; Collamore are coming to make
the rooms up, and her mother is busy as a bee getting us in
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are going to be lodged like
a prince. I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to keep it up; but law
business comes in rather slowly at first, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know it isn&rsquo;t the way I should furnish, if
my capital was the one to cash the bills; but then, you see,
Sophie&rsquo;s people do it, and let them,&mdash;a girl doesn&rsquo;t want
to come down out of the style she has always lived in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said nothing, but had an oppressive presentiment that
social freedom would expire in that house, crushed under a
weight of upholstery.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>But there came in due time the wedding and the wedding-reception,
and we all went to see Bill in his new house, splendidly
lighted up and complete from top to toe, and everybody
said what a lucky fellow he was; but that was about
the end of it, so far as our visiting was concerned. The
running in, and dropping in, and keeping latch-keys, and
making informal calls, that had been forespoken, seemed
about as likely as if Bill had lodged in the Tuileries.</p>
<p>Sophie, who had always been one of your snapping,
sparkling, busy sort of girls, began at once to develop her
womanhood and show her principles, and was as different
from her former self as your careworn, mousing old cat is
from your rollicking, frisky kitten. Not but that Sophie
was a good girl. She had a capital heart, a good, true
womanly one, and was loving and obliging; but still she
was one of the desperately painstaking, conscientious sort of
women whose very blood, as they grow older, is devoured
with anxiety, and she came of a race of women in whom
housekeeping was more than an art or a science,&mdash;it was,
so to speak, a religion. Sophie&rsquo;s mother, aunts, and grandmothers,
for nameless generations back, were known and
celebrated housekeepers. They might have been genuine
descendants of the inhabitants of that Hollandic town of
Broeck, celebrated by Washington Irving, where the cows&rsquo;
tails are kept tied up with unsullied blue ribbons, and the
ends of the fire-wood are painted white. He relates how a
celebrated preacher, visiting this town, found it impossible
to draw these housewives from their earthly views and employments,
until he took to preaching on the neatness of the
celestial city, the unsullied crystal of its walls and the polish
of its golden pavement, when the faces of all the housewives
were set Zionward at once.</p>
<p>Now this solemn and earnest view of housekeeping is
onerous enough when a poor girl first enters on the care of
a moderately furnished house, where the articles are not too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
expensive to be reasonably renewed as time and use wear
them; but it is infinitely worse when a cataract of splendid
furniture is heaped upon her care,&mdash;when splendid crystals
cut into her conscience, and mirrors reflect her duties, and
moth and rust stand ever ready to devour and sully in every
room and passageway.</p>
<p>Sophie was solemnly warned and instructed by all the
mothers and aunts,&mdash;she was warned of moths, warned of
cockroaches, warned of flies, warned of dust; all the articles
of furniture had their covers, made of cold Holland linen,
in which they looked like bodies laid out,&mdash;even the curtain
tassels had each its little shroud,&mdash;and bundles of receipts,
and of rites and ceremonies necessary for the preservation
and purification and care of all these articles, were stuffed
into the poor girl&rsquo;s head, before guiltless of cares as the
feathers that floated above it.</p>
<p>Poor Bill found very soon that his house and furniture
were to be kept at such an ideal point of perfection that he
needed another house to live in,&mdash;for, poor fellow, he found
the difference between having a house and a home. It was
only a year or two after that my wife and I started our
ménage on very different principles, and Bill would often drop
in upon us, wistfully lingering in the cosy armchair between
my writing-table and my wife&rsquo;s sofa, and saying with a sigh
how confoundedly pleasant things looked there,&mdash;so pleasant
to have a bright, open fire, and geraniums and roses and
birds, and all that sort of thing, and to dare to stretch out
one&rsquo;s legs and move without thinking what one was going
to hit. &ldquo;Sophie is a good girl!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;and
wants to have everything right, but you see they won&rsquo;t let
her. They&rsquo;ve loaded her with so many things that have
to be kept in lavender that the poor girl is actually getting
thin and losing her health; and then, you see, there&rsquo;s
Aunt Zeruah, she mounts guard at our house, and keeps up
such strict police regulations that a fellow can&rsquo;t do a thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
The parlors are splendid, but so lonesome and dismal!&mdash;not
a ray of sunshine, in fact not a ray of light, except when
a visitor is calling, and then they open a crack. They&rsquo;re
afraid of flies, and yet, dear knows, they keep every looking-glass
and picture-frame muffled to its throat from March to
December. I&rsquo;d like, for curiosity, to see what a fly would
do in our parlors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you have some little family sitting-room
where you can make yourselves cosy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. Sophie and Aunt Zeruah have fixed
their throne up in our bedroom, and there they sit all day
long, except at calling-hours, and then Sophie dresses herself
and comes down. Aunt Zeruah insists upon it that the
way is to put the whole house in order, and shut all the
blinds, and sit in your bedroom, and then, she says, nothing
gets out of place; and she tells poor Sophie the most hocus-pocus
stories about her grandmothers and aunts, who always
kept everything in their houses so that they could go and
lay their hands on it in the darkest night. I&rsquo;ll bet they
could in our house. From end to end it is kept looking as
if we had shut it up and gone to Europe,&mdash;not a book, not
a paper, not a glove, or any trace of a human being in sight;
the piano shut tight, the bookcases shut and locked, the
engravings locked up, all the drawers and closets locked.
Why, if I want to take a fellow into the library, in the first
place it smells like a vault, and I have to unbarricade windows,
and unlock and rummage for half an hour before I
can get at anything; and I know Aunt Zeruah is standing
tiptoe at the door, ready to whip everything back and lock
up again. A fellow can&rsquo;t be social, or take any comfort in
showing his books and pictures that way. Then there&rsquo;s our
great, light dining-room, with its sunny south windows,&mdash;Aunt
Zeruah got us out of that early in April, because she
said the flies would speck the frescoes and get into the china-closet,
and we have been eating in a little dingy den, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
a window looking out on a back alley, ever since; and Aunt
Zeruah says that now the dining-room is always in perfect
order, and that it is such a care off Sophie&rsquo;s mind that I
ought to be willing to eat down cellar to the end of the
chapter. Now, you see, Chris, my position is a delicate
one, because Sophie&rsquo;s folks all agree that, if there is anything
in creation that is ignorant and dreadful and mustn&rsquo;t
be allowed his way anywhere, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;a man.&rsquo; Why, you&rsquo;d
think, to hear Aunt Zeruah talk, that we were all like bulls
in a china-shop, ready to toss and tear and rend, if we are
not kept down cellar and chained; and she worries Sophie,
and Sophie&rsquo;s mother comes in and worries, and if I try to
get anything done differently Sophie cries, and says she don&rsquo;t
know what to do, and so I give it up. Now, if I want to
ask a few of our set in sociably to dinner, I can&rsquo;t have them
where we eat down cellar,&mdash;oh, that would never do! Aunt
Zeruah and Sophie&rsquo;s mother and the whole family would
think the family honor was forever ruined and undone. We
mustn&rsquo;t ask them unless we open the dining-room, and have
out all the best china, and get the silver home from the
bank; and if we do that, Aunt Zeruah doesn&rsquo;t sleep for a
week beforehand, getting ready for it, and for a week after,
getting things put away; and then she tells me that, in Sophie&rsquo;s
delicate state, it really is abominable for me to increase
her cares, and so I invite fellows to dine with me at Delmonico&rsquo;s,
and then Sophie cries, and Sophie&rsquo;s mother says it
doesn&rsquo;t look respectable for a family man to be dining at public
places; but, hang it, a fellow wants a home somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife soothed the chafed spirit, and spake comfortably
unto him, and told him that he knew there was the old
lounging-chair always ready for him at our fireside. &ldquo;And
you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;our things are all so plain that we
are never tempted to mount any guard over them; our carpets
are nothing, and therefore we let the sun fade them,
and live on the sunshine and the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Bill bitterly. &ldquo;Carpets fading,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Aunt Zeruah&rsquo;s monomania. These women think that
the great object of houses is to keep out sunshine. What a
fool I was when I gloated over the prospect of our sunny
south windows! Why, man, there are three distinct sets of
fortifications against the sunshine in those windows: first,
outside blinds; then solid, folding, inside shutters; and,
lastly, heavy, thick, lined damask curtains, which loop quite
down to the floor. What&rsquo;s the use of my pictures, I desire
to know? They are hung in that room, and it&rsquo;s a regular
campaign to get light enough to see what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, at all events, you can light them up with gas in
the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the evening! Why, do you know my wife never
wants to sit there in the evening? She says she has so
much sewing to do that she and Aunt Zeruah must sit up
in the bedroom, because it wouldn&rsquo;t do to bring work into
the parlor. Didn&rsquo;t you know that? Don&rsquo;t you know there
mustn&rsquo;t be such a thing as a bit of real work ever seen in
a parlor? What if some threads should drop on the carpet?
Aunt Zeruah would have to open all the fortifications next
day, and search Jerusalem with candles to find them. No;
in the evening the gas is lighted at half-cock, you know;
and if I turn it up, and bring in my newspapers and spread
about me, and pull down some books to read, I can feel the
nervousness through the chamber floor. Aunt Zeruah looks
in at eight, and at a quarter past, and at half past, and at
nine, and at ten, to see if I am done, so that she may fold
up the papers and put a book on them, and lock up the books
in their cases. Nobody ever comes in to spend an evening.
They used to try it when we were first married, but I believe
the uninhabited appearance of our parlors discouraged them.
Everybody has stopped coming now, and Aunt Zeruah says
&lsquo;it is such a comfort, for now the rooms are always in order.
How poor Mrs. Crowfield lives, with her house such a thoroughfare,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
she is sure she can&rsquo;t see. Sophie never would have
strength for it; but then, to be sure, some folks ain&rsquo;t as
particular as others. Sophie was brought up in a family of
very particular housekeepers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife smiled, with that calm, easy, amused smile that
has brightened up her sofa for so many years.</p>
<p>Bill added bitterly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t say that I wished the whole set
and system of housekeeping women at the&mdash;what-&rsquo;s-his-name?&mdash;because
Sophie would have cried for a week, and
been utterly forlorn and disconsolate. I know it&rsquo;s not the
poor girl&rsquo;s fault; I try sometimes to reason with her, but
you can&rsquo;t reason with the whole of your wife&rsquo;s family, to
the third and fourth generation backwards; but I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s hurting her health,&mdash;wearing her out. Why, you
know Sophie used to be the life of our set; and now she
really seems eaten up with care from morning to night,
there are so many things in the house that something dreadful
is happening to all the while, and the servants we get
are so clumsy. Why, when I sit with Sophie and Aunt
Zeruah, it&rsquo;s nothing but a constant string of complaints
about the girls in the kitchen. We keep changing our servants
all the time, and they break and destroy so that now
we are turned out of the use of all our things. We not
only eat in the basement, but all our pretty table-things are
put away, and we have all the cracked plates and cracked
tumblers and cracked teacups and old buck-handled knives
that can be raised out of chaos. I could use these things
and be merry if I didn&rsquo;t know we had better ones; and
I can&rsquo;t help wondering whether there isn&rsquo;t some way that
our table could be set to look like a gentleman&rsquo;s table; but
Aunt Zeruah says that &lsquo;it would cost thousands, and what
difference does it make as long as nobody sees it but us?&rsquo;
You see, there is no medium in her mind between china
and crystal and cracked earthenware. Well, I&rsquo;m wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
how all these laws of the Medes and Persians are going
to work when the children come along. I&rsquo;m in hopes the
children will soften off the old folks, and make the house
more habitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, children did come, a good many of them, in time.
There was Tom, a broad-shouldered, chubby-cheeked, active,
hilarious son of mischief, born in the very image of his
father; and there was Charlie, and Jim, and Louisa, and
Sophie the second, and Frank,&mdash;and a better, brighter,
more joy-giving household, as far as temperament and nature
were concerned, never existed.</p>
<p>But their whole childhood was a long battle,&mdash;children
versus furniture, and furniture always carried the day. The
first step of the housekeeping powers was to choose the
least agreeable and least available room in the house for the
children&rsquo;s nursery, and to fit it up with all the old, cracked,
rickety furniture a neighboring auction-shop could afford,
and then to keep them in it. Now everybody knows that
to bring up children to be upright, true, generous, and religious
needs so much discipline, so much restraint and correction,
and so many rules and regulations, that it is all
that the parents can carry out, and all the children can bear.
There is only a certain amount of the vital force for parents
or children to use in this business of education, and one
must choose what it shall be used for. The Aunt Zeruah
faction chose to use it for keeping the house and furniture,
and the children&rsquo;s education proceeded accordingly. The
rules of right and wrong of which they heard most frequently
were all of this sort: Naughty children were those
who went up the front stairs, or sat on the best sofa, or fingered
any of the books in the library, or got out one of the
best teacups, or drank out of the cut-glass goblets.</p>
<p>Why did they ever want to do it? If there ever is a
forbidden fruit in an Eden, will not our young Adams and
Eves risk soul and body to find out how it tastes? Little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Tom, the oldest boy, had the courage and enterprise and
perseverance of a Captain Parry or Dr. Kane, and he used
them all in voyages of discovery to forbidden grounds. He
stole Aunt Zeruah&rsquo;s keys, unlocked her cupboards and
closets, saw, handled, and tasted everything for himself,
and gloried in his sins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Tom,&rdquo; said the nurse to him once,
&ldquo;if you are so noisy and rude, you&rsquo;ll disturb your dear
mamma? She&rsquo;s sick, and she may die, if you&rsquo;re not
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she die?&rdquo; says Tom gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Tom, turning on his heel,&mdash;&ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll
go up the front stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as ever the little rebel was old enough, he was
sent away to boarding-school, and then there was never found
a time when it was convenient to have him come home again.
He could not come in the spring, for then they were house-cleaning,
nor in the autumn, because then they were house-cleaning;
and so he spent his vacations at school, unless, by
good luck, a companion who was so fortunate as to have a
home invited him there. His associations, associates, habits,
principles, were as little known to his mother as if she had
sent him to China. Aunt Zeruah used to congratulate herself
on the rest there was at home, now he was gone, and
say she was only living in hopes of the time when Charlie
and Jim would be big enough to send away, too; and meanwhile
Charlie and Jim, turned out of the charmed circle
which should hold growing boys to the father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s
side, detesting the dingy, lonely playroom, used to run the
city streets, and hang round the railroad depots or docks.
Parents may depend upon it that, if they do not make an
attractive resort for their boys, Satan will. There are places
enough, kept warm and light and bright and merry, where
boys can go whose mothers&rsquo; parlors are too fine for them to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
sit in. There are enough to be found to clap them on the
back, and tell them stories that their mothers must not hear,
and laugh when they compass with their little piping voices
the dreadful litanies of sin and shame. In middle life, our
poor Sophie, who as a girl was so gay and frolicsome, so full
of spirits, had dried and sharpened into a hard-visaged,
angular woman,&mdash;careful and troubled about many things,
and forgetful that one thing is needful. One of the boys
had run away to sea; I believe he has never been heard of.
As to Tom, the eldest, he ran a career wild and hard enough
for a time, first at school and then in college, and there came
a time when he came home, in the full might of six feet two,
and almost broke his mother&rsquo;s heart with his assertions of
his home rights and privileges. Mothers who throw away
the key of their children&rsquo;s hearts and childhood sometimes
have a sad retribution. As the children never were considered
when they were little and helpless, so they do not
consider when they are strong and powerful. Tom spread
wide desolation among the household gods, lounging on the
sofas, spitting tobacco juice on the carpets, scattering books
and engravings hither and thither, and throwing all the
family traditions into wild disorder, as he would never have
done had not all his childish remembrances of them been
embittered by the association of restraint and privation.
He actually seemed to hate any appearance of luxury or
taste or order,&mdash;he was a perfect Philistine.</p>
<p>As for my friend Bill, from being the pleasantest and
most genial of fellows, he became a morose, misanthropic
man. Dr. Franklin has a significant proverb,&mdash;&ldquo;Silks and
satins put out the kitchen fire.&rdquo; Silks and satins&mdash;meaning
by them the luxuries of housekeeping&mdash;often put out
not only the parlor fire, but that more sacred flame, the fire
of domestic love. It is the greatest possible misery to a
man and to his children to be homeless; and many a man
has a splendid house, but no home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;you ought to write and tell what
are your ideas of keeping a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, you have only to think how your mother has
brought you up.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Nevertheless, I think, being so fortunate a husband, I
might reduce my wife&rsquo;s system to an analysis, and my next
paper shall be, What is a Home, and How to Keep it.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h3>III <br /><br />WHAT IS A HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>It is among the sibylline secrets which lie mysteriously between
you and me, O reader, that these papers, besides their
public aspect, have a private one proper to the bosom of
mine own particular family. They are not merely an <i>ex
post facto</i> protest in regard to that carpet and parlor of celebrated
memory, but they are forth-looking towards other
homes that may yet arise near us. For, among my other
confidences, you may recollect I stated to you that our Marianne
was busy in those interesting cares and details which
relate to the preparing and ordering of another dwelling.</p>
<p>Now, when any such matter is going on in a family, I
have observed that every feminine instinct is in a state of
fluttering vitality,&mdash;every woman, old or young, is alive
with womanliness to the tips of her fingers; and it becomes
us of the other sex, however consciously respected, to walk
softly and put forth our sentiments discreetly, and with due
reverence for the mysterious powers that reign in the feminine
breast.</p>
<p>I had been too well advised to offer one word of direct
counsel on a subject where there were such charming
voices, so able to convict me of absurdity at every turn. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
had merely so arranged my affairs as to put into the hands
of my bankers, subject to my wife&rsquo;s order, the very modest
marriage portion which I could place at my girl&rsquo;s disposal;
and Marianne and Jenny, unused to the handling of
money, were incessant in their discussions with ever patient
mamma as to what was to be done with it. I say Marianne
and Jenny, for, though the case undoubtedly is
Marianne&rsquo;s, yet, like everything else in our domestic proceedings,
it seems to fall, somehow or other, into Jenny&rsquo;s
hands, through the intensity and liveliness of her domesticity
of nature. Little Jenny is so bright and wide awake,
and with so many active plans and fancies touching anything
in the housekeeping world, that, though the youngest sister
and second party in this affair, a stranger, hearkening
to the daily discussions, might listen a half-hour at a time
without finding out that it was not Jenny&rsquo;s future establishment
that was in question. Marianne is a soft, thoughtful,
quiet girl, not given to many words; and though,
when you come fairly at it, you will find that, like most
quiet girls, she has a will five times as inflexible as one
who talks more, yet in all family counsels it is Jenny and
mamma that do the discussion, and her own little well-considered
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; that finally settles each case.</p>
<p>I must add to this family tableau the portrait of the excellent
Bob Stephens, who figured as future proprietor and
householder in these consultations. So far as the question
of financial possibilities is concerned, it is important to remark
that Bob belongs to the class of young Edmunds celebrated
by the poet:&mdash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Wisdom and worth were all he had.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He is, in fact, an excellent-hearted and clever fellow,
with a world of agreeable talents, a good tenor in a parlor
duet, a good actor at a charade, a lively, off-hand conversationist,
well up in all the current literature of the day, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
what is more, in my eyes, a well-read lawyer, just admitted
to the bar, and with as fair business prospects as usually
fall to the lot of young aspirants in that profession.</p>
<p>Of course, he and my girl are duly and truly in love, in
all the proper moods and tenses; but as to this work they
have in hand of being householders, managing fuel, rent,
provision, taxes, gas and water rates, they seem to my
older eyes about as sagacious as a pair of this year&rsquo;s robins.
Nevertheless, as the robins of each year do somehow learn
to build nests as well as their ancestors, there is reason to
hope as much for each new pair of human creatures. But
it is one of the fatalities of our ill-jointed life that houses
are usually furnished for future homes by young people in
just this state of blissful ignorance of what they are really
wanted for, or what is likely to be done with the things in
them.</p>
<p>Now, to people of large incomes, with ready wealth for
the rectification of mistakes, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter how
the ménage is arranged at first; they will, if they have
good sense, soon rid themselves of the little infelicities and
absurdities of their first arrangements, and bring their establishment
to meet their more instructed tastes.</p>
<p>But to that greater class who have only a modest investment
for this first start in domestic life, mistakes are far
more serious. I have known people go on for years groaning
under the weight of domestic possessions they did not
want, and pining in vain for others which they did, simply
from the fact that all their first purchases were made in this
time of blissful ignorance.</p>
<p>I had been a quiet auditor to many animated discussions
among the young people as to what they wanted and were
to get, in which the subject of prudence and economy was
discussed, with quotations of advice thereon given in serious
good faith by various friends and relations who lived easily
on incomes four or five times larger than our own. Who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
can show the ways of elegant economy more perfectly than
people thus at ease in their possessions? From what serene
heights do they instruct the inexperienced beginners! Ten
thousand a year gives one leisure for reflection, and elegant
leisure enables one to view household economies dispassionately;
hence the unction with which these gifted daughters
of upper air delight to exhort young neophytes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear,&rdquo; Aunt Sophia Easygo had
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always the best economy to get the best things.
They cost more in the beginning, but see how they last!
These velvet carpets on my floor have been in constant wear
for ten years, and look how they wear! I never have an ingrain
carpet in my house,&mdash;not even on the chambers. Velvet
and Brussels cost more to begin with, but then they last.
Then I cannot recommend the fashion that is creeping in
of having plate instead of solid silver. Plate wears off, and
has to be renewed, which comes to about the same thing in
the end as if you bought all solid at first. If I were beginning
as Marianne is, I should just set aside a thousand
dollars for my silver, and be content with a few plain articles.
She should buy all her furniture at Messrs. David &amp;
Saul&rsquo;s. People call them dear, but their work will prove
cheapest in the end, and there is an air and style about their
things that can be told anywhere. Of course, you won&rsquo;t go
to any extravagant lengths,&mdash;simplicity is a grace of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waters of the family council were troubled when
Jenny, flaming with enthusiasm, brought home the report
of this conversation. When my wife proceeded, with her
well-trained business knowledge, to compare the prices of
the simplest elegancies recommended by Aunt Easygo with
the sum total to be drawn on, faces lengthened perceptibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>are</i> people to go to housekeeping,&rdquo; said Jenny,
&ldquo;if everything costs so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife quietly remarked that we had had great comfort
in our own home,&mdash;had entertained unnumbered friends, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
had only ingrain carpets on our chambers and a three-ply on
our parlor, and she doubted if any guest had ever thought of
it,&mdash;if the rooms had been a shade less pleasant; and as
to durability, Aunt Easygo had renewed her carpets oftener
than we. Such as ours were, they had worn longer than hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, you know everything has gone on since
your day. Everybody must at least approach a certain style
nowadays. One can&rsquo;t furnish so far behind other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife answered in her quiet way, setting forth her doctrine
of a plain average to go through the whole establishment,
placing parlors, chambers, kitchen, pantries, and the
unseen depths of linen-closets in harmonious relations of
just proportion, and showed by calm estimates how far the
sum given could go towards this result. <i>There</i> the limits
were inexorable. There is nothing so damping to the ardor
of youthful economies as the hard, positive logic of figures.
It is so delightful to think in some airy way that the things
we like best are the cheapest, and that a sort of rigorous
duty compels us to get them at any sacrifice. There is no
remedy for this illusion but to show by the multiplication
and addition tables what things are and are not possible.
My wife&rsquo;s figures met Aunt Easygo&rsquo;s assertions, and there
was a lull among the high contracting parties for a season;
nevertheless, I could see Jenny was secretly uneasy. I
began to hear of journeys made to far places, here and there,
where expensive articles of luxury were selling at reduced
prices. Now a gilded mirror was discussed, and now a
velvet carpet which chance had brought down temptingly
near the sphere of financial possibility. I thought of our
parlor, and prayed the good fairies to avert the advent of
ill-assorted articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray keep common sense uppermost in the girls&rsquo; heads,
if you can,&rdquo; said I to Mrs. Crowfield, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let the
poor little puss spend her money for what she won&rsquo;t care a
button about by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you know Marianne is
inexperienced, and Jenny is so ardent and active, and so
confident, too. Then they both, I think, have the impression
that we are a little behind the age. To say the truth,
my dear, I think your papers afford a good opportunity of
dropping a thought now and then in their minds. Jenny
was asking last night when you were going to write your
next paper. The girl has a bright, active mind, and thinks
of what she hears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So flattered, by the best of flatterers, I sat down to write
on my theme; and that evening, at firelight time, I read
to my little senate as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>WHAT IS A HOME, AND HOW TO KEEP IT</h4>
<p>I have shown that a dwelling, rented or owned by a
man, in which his own wife keeps house, is not always, or
of course, a home. What is it, then, that makes a home?
All men and women have the indefinite knowledge of
what they want and long for when that word is spoken.
&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; sighs the disconsolate bachelor, tired of boarding-house
fare and buttonless shirts. &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; says the wanderer
in foreign lands, and thinks of mother&rsquo;s love, of wife
and sister and child. Nay, the word has in it a higher
meaning hallowed by religion; and when the Christian
would express the highest of his hopes for a better life, he
speaks of his <i>home</i> beyond the grave. The word &ldquo;home&rdquo; has
in it the elements of love, rest, permanency, and liberty;
but, besides these, it has in it the idea of an education by
which all that is purest within us is developed into nobler
forms, fit for a higher life. The little child by the home-fireside
was taken on the Master&rsquo;s knee when he would
explain to his disciples the mysteries of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Of so great dignity and worth is this holy and sacred
thing, that the power to create a <span class='smcaplc'>HOME</span> ought to be ranked
above all creative faculties. The sculptor who brings out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the breathing statue from cold marble, the painter who
warms the canvas into a deathless glow of beauty, the architect
who built cathedrals and hung the world-like dome of
St. Peter&rsquo;s in midair, is not to be compared, in sanctity and
worthiness, to the humblest artist who, out of the poor
materials afforded by this shifting, changing, selfish world,
creates the secure Eden of a home.</p>
<p>A true home should be called the noblest work of art
possible to human creatures, inasmuch as it is the very
image chosen to represent the last and highest rest of the
soul, the consummation of man&rsquo;s blessedness.</p>
<p>Not without reason does the oldest Christian church require
of those entering on marriage the most solemn review
of all the past life, the confession and repentance of every
sin of thought, word, and deed, and the reception of the
holy sacrament; for thus the man and woman who approach
the august duty of creating a home are reminded of the
sanctity and beauty of what they undertake.</p>
<p>In this art of homemaking I have set down in my mind
certain first principles, like the axioms of Euclid, and the
first is,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>No home is possible without love.</i></p>
<p>All business marriages and marriages of convenience, all
mere culinary marriages and marriages of mere animal
passion, make the creation of a true home impossible in the
outset. Love is the jeweled foundation of this New Jerusalem
descending from God out of heaven, and takes as
many bright forms as the amethyst, topaz, and sapphire of
that mysterious vision. In this range of creative art all
things are possible to him that loveth, but without love
nothing is possible.</p>
<p>We hear of most convenient marriages in foreign lands,
which may better be described as commercial partnerships.
The money on each side is counted; there is enough between
the parties to carry on the firm, each having the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
appropriate sum allotted to each. No love is pretended, but
there is great politeness. All is so legally and thoroughly
arranged that there seems to be nothing left for future
quarrels to fasten on. Monsieur and Madame have each their
apartments, their carriages, their servants, their income, their
friends, their pursuits,&mdash;understand the solemn vows of
marriage to mean simply that they are to treat each other
with urbanity in those few situations where the path of life
must necessarily bring them together.</p>
<p>We are sorry that such an idea of marriage should be
gaining foothold in America. It has its root in an ignoble
view of life,&mdash;an utter and pagan darkness as to all that
man and woman are called to do in that highest relation
where they act as one. It is a mean and low contrivance
on both sides, by which all the grand work of home-building,
all the noble pains and heroic toils of home education&mdash;that
education where the parents learn more than they
teach&mdash;shall be (let us use the expressive Yankee idiom)
<i>shirked</i>.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that, in those countries where this system
of marriages is the general rule, there is no word corresponding
to our English word &ldquo;home.&rdquo; In many polite languages
of Europe it would be impossible neatly to translate
the sentiment with which we began this essay, that a man&rsquo;s
house is not always his home.</p>
<p>Let any one try to render the song, &ldquo;Sweet Home,&rdquo; into
French, and one finds how Anglo-Saxon is the very genius
of the word. The structure of life, in all its relations, in
countries where marriages are matter of arrangement and
not of love, excludes the idea of home.</p>
<p>How does life run in such countries? The girl is recalled
from her convent or boarding-school, and told that
her father has found a husband for her. No objection on
her part is contemplated or provided for; none generally
occurs, for the child is only too happy to obtain the fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
clothes and the liberty which she has been taught come only
with marriage. Be the man handsome or homely, interesting
or stupid, still he brings these.</p>
<p>How intolerable such a marriage! we say, with the close
intimacies of Anglo-Saxon life in our minds. They are not
intolerable, because they are provided for by arrangements
which make it possible for each to go his or her several way,
seeing very little of the other. The son or daughter, which
in due time makes its appearance in this ménage, is sent out
to nurse in infancy, sent to boarding-school in youth, and
in maturity portioned and married, to repeat the same process
for another generation. Meanwhile father and mother keep
a quiet establishment and pursue their several pleasures.
Such is the system.</p>
<p>Houses built for this kind of life become mere sets of reception-rooms,
such as are the greater proportion of apartments
to let in Paris, where a hearty English or American
family, with their children about them, could scarcely find
room to establish themselves. Individual character, it is
true, does something to modify this programme. There are
charming homes in France and Italy, where warm and noble
natures, thrown together perhaps by accident, or mated by
wise paternal choice, infuse warmth into the coldness of the
system under which they live. There are in all states of
society some of such domesticity of nature that they will
create a home around themselves under any circumstances,
however barren. Besides, so kindly is human nature, that
Love, uninvited before marriage, often becomes a guest after,
and with Love always comes a home.</p>
<p>My next axiom is,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>There can be no true home without liberty.</i></p>
<p>The very idea of home is of a retreat where we shall be
free to act out personal and individual tastes and peculiarities,
as we cannot do before the wide world. We are to
have our meals at what hour we will, served in what style
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
suits us. Our hours of going and coming are to be as we
please. Our favorite haunts are to be here or there; our
pictures and books so disposed as seems to us good; and our
whole arrangements the expression, so far as our means can
compass it, of our own personal ideas of what is pleasant
and desirable in life. This element of liberty, if we think
of it, is the chief charm of home. &ldquo;Here I can do as I
please,&rdquo; is the thought with which the tempest-tossed
earth-pilgrim blesses himself or herself, turning inward from
the crowded ways of the world. This thought blesses the
man of business, as he turns from his day&rsquo;s care and crosses
the sacred threshold. It is as restful to him as the slippers
and gown and easy-chair by the fireside. Everybody understands
him here. Everybody is well content that he should
take his ease in his own way. Such is the case in the ideal
home. That such is not always the case in the real home
comes often from the mistakes in the house-furnishing.
Much house-furnishing is too fine for liberty.</p>
<p>In America there is no such thing as rank and station
which impose a sort of prescriptive style on people of certain
income. The consequence is that all sorts of furniture and
belongings, which in the Old World have a recognized relation
to certain possibilities of income, and which require certain
other accessories to make them in good keeping, are thrown
in the way of all sorts of people.</p>
<p>Young people who cannot expect by any reasonable possibility
to keep more than two or three servants, if they happen
to have the means in the outset furnish a house with
just such articles as in England would suit an establishment
of sixteen. We have seen houses in England having two
or three housemaids, and tables served by a butler and
two waiters, where the furniture, carpets, china, crystal, and
silver were in one and the same style with some establishments
in America where the family was hard pressed to keep
three Irish servants.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>This want of servants is the one thing that must modify
everything in American life; it is, and will long continue
to be, a leading feature in the life of a country so rich in
openings for man and woman that domestic service can be
only the stepping-stone to something higher. Nevertheless
we Americans are great travelers; we are sensitive, appreciative,
fond of novelty, apt to receive and incorporate into
our own life what seems fair and graceful in that of other
people. Our women&rsquo;s wardrobes are made elaborate with
the thousand elegancies of French toilet,&mdash;our houses filled
with a thousand knick-knacks of which our plain ancestors
never dreamed. Cleopatra did not set sail on the Nile in
more state and beauty than that in which our young American
bride is often ushered into her new home,&mdash;her wardrobe
all gossamer lace and quaint frill and crimp and embroidery,
her house a museum of elegant and costly gewgaws, and,
amid the whole collection of elegancies and fragilities, she,
perhaps, the frailest.</p>
<p>Then comes the tug of war. The young wife becomes
a mother, and while she is retired to her chamber, blundering
Biddy rusts the elegant knives, or takes off the ivory
handles by soaking in hot water; the silver is washed in
greasy soapsuds, and refreshed now and then with a thump,
which cocks the nose of the teapot awry, or makes the
handle assume an air of drunken defiance. The fragile
china is chipped here and there around its edges with those
minute gaps so vexatious to a woman&rsquo;s soul; the handles
fly hither and thither in the wild confusion of Biddy&rsquo;s
washing-day hurry, when cook wants her to help hang out
the clothes. Meanwhile Bridget sweeps the parlor with a
hard broom, and shakes out showers of ashes from the grate,
forgetting to cover the damask lounges, and they directly
look as rusty and time-worn as if they had come from an
auction-store; and all together unite in making such havoc
of the delicate ruffles and laces of the bridal outfit and baby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
<i>layette</i> that, when the poor young wife comes out of her
chamber after her nurse has left her, and, weakened and
embarrassed with the demands of the newcomer, begins
to look once more into the affairs of her little world, she
is ready to sink with vexation and discouragement. Poor
little princess! Her clothes are made as princesses wear
them, her baby&rsquo;s clothes like a young duke&rsquo;s, her house
furnished like a lord&rsquo;s, and only Bridget and Biddy and
Polly to do the work of cook, scullery-maid, butler, footman,
laundress, nursery-maid, housemaid, and lady&rsquo;s maid.
Such is the array that in the Old Country would be deemed
necessary to take care of an establishment got up like hers.
Everything in it is too fine,&mdash;not too fine to be pretty, not
in bad taste in itself, but too fine for the situation, too fine
for comfort or liberty.</p>
<p>What ensues in a house so furnished? Too often, ceaseless
fretting of the nerves, in the wife&rsquo;s despairing, conscientious
efforts to keep things as they should be. There
is no freedom in a house where things are too expensive
and choice to be freely handled and easily replaced. Life
becomes a series of petty embarrassments and restrictions,
something is always going wrong, and the man finds his
fireside oppressive,&mdash;the various articles of his parlor and
table seem like so many temper-traps and spring-guns, menacing
explosion and disaster.</p>
<p>There may be, indeed, the most perfect home-feeling, the
utmost cosiness and restfulness, in apartments crusted with
gilding, carpeted with velvet, and upholstered with satin.
I have seen such, where the home-like look and air of free
use was as genuine as in a Western log cabin; but this was
in a range of princely income that made all these things as
easy to be obtained or replaced as the most ordinary of our
domestic furniture. But so long as articles must be shrouded
from use, or used with fear and trembling, because their
cost is above the general level of our means, we had better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
be without them, even though the most lucky of accidents
may put their possession in our power.</p>
<p>But it is not merely by the effort to maintain too much
elegance that the sense of home liberty is banished from a
house. It is sometimes expelled in another way, with all
painstaking and conscientious strictness, by the worthiest
and best of human beings, the blessed followers of Saint
Martha. Have we not known them, the deaf, worthy creatures,
up before daylight, causing most scrupulous lustrations
of every pane of glass and inch of paint in our parlors,
in consequence whereof every shutter and blind must be
kept closed for days to come, lest the flies should speck the
freshly washed windows and wainscoting? Dear shade of
Aunt Mehitabel, forgive our boldness! Have we not been
driven for days, in our youth, to read our newspaper in the
front veranda, in the kitchen, out in the barn,&mdash;anywhere,
in fact, where sunshine could be found,&mdash;because there was
not a room in the house that was not cleaned, shut up, and
darkened? Have we not shivered with cold, all the glowering,
gloomy month of May, because, the august front parlor
having undergone the spring cleaning, the andirons were
snugly tied up in the tissue-paper, and an elegant frill of
the same material was trembling before the mouth of the
once glowing fireplace? Even so, dear soul, full of loving-kindness
and hospitality as thou wast, yet ever making our
house seem like a tomb! And with what patience wouldst
thou sit sewing by a crack in the shutters an inch wide,
rejoicing in thy immaculate paint and clear glass! But
was there ever a thing of thy spotless and unsullied belongings
which a boy might use? How I trembled to touch
thy scoured tins, that hung in appalling brightness! with
what awe I asked for a basket to pick strawberries! and
where in the house could I find a place to eat a piece of
gingerbread? How like a ruffian, a Tartar, a pirate, I always
felt when I entered thy domains! and how, from day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
to day, I wondered at the immeasurable depths of depravity
which were always leading me to upset something, or break
or tear or derange something, in thy exquisitely kept premises!
Somehow the impression was burned with overpowering
force into my mind that houses and furniture,
scrubbed floors, white curtains, bright tins and brasses, were
the great, awful, permanent facts of existence; and that
men and women, and particularly children, were the meddlesome
intruders upon this divine order, every trace of
whose intermeddling must be scrubbed out and obliterated
in the quickest way possible. It seemed evident to me
that houses would be far more perfect if nobody lived in
them at all, but that, as men had really and absurdly taken
to living in them, they must live as little as possible. My
only idea of a house was a place full of traps and pitfalls
for boys, a deadly temptation to sins which beset one every
moment; and when I read about a sailor&rsquo;s free life on the
ocean, I felt an untold longing to go forth and be free in
like manner.</p>
<p>But a truce to these fancies, and back again to our essay.</p>
<p>If liberty in a house is a comfort to a husband, it is a
necessity to children. When we say liberty, we do not
mean license. We do not mean that Master Johnny be
allowed to handle elegant volumes with bread-and-butter
fingers, or that little Miss be suffered to drum on the piano,
or practice line-drawing with a pin on varnished furniture.
Still it is essential that the family parlors be not too fine
for the family to sit in,&mdash;too fine for the ordinary accidents,
haps and mishaps of reasonably well-trained children.
The elegance of the parlor where papa and mamma sit and
receive their friends should wear an inviting, not a hostile
and bristling, aspect to little people. Its beauty and its
order gradually form in the little mind a love of beauty and
order, and the insensible carefulness of regard.</p>
<p>Nothing is worse for a child than to shut him up in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
room which he understands is his, <i>because</i> he is disorderly,&mdash;where
he is expected, of course, to maintain and keep disorder.
We have sometimes pitied the poor little victims
who show their faces longingly at the doors of elegant parlors,
and are forthwith collared by the domestic police and
consigned to some attic apartment, called a playroom, where
chaos continually reigns. It is a mistake to suppose, because
children derange a well-furnished apartment, that
they like confusion. Order and beauty are always pleasant
to them as to grown people, and disorder and defacement
are painful; but they know neither how to create the one
nor to prevent the other,&mdash;their little lives are a series of
experiments, often making disorder by aiming at some new
form of order. Yet, for all this, I am not one of those who
feel that in a family everything should bend to the sway
of these little people. They are the worst of tyrants in
such houses: still, where children are, though the fact must
not appear to them, <i>nothing must be done without a wise
thought of them</i>.</p>
<p>Here, as in all high art, the old motto is in force, &ldquo;<i>Ars
est celare artem</i>.&rdquo; Children who are taught too plainly, by
every anxious look and word of their parents, by every
family arrangement, by the impressment of every chance
guest into the service, that their parents consider their education
as the one important matter in creation, are apt to
grow up fantastical, artificial, and hopelessly self-conscious.
The stars cannot stop in their courses, even for our personal
improvement, and the sooner children learn this the better.
The great art is to organize a home which shall move on
with a strong, wide, generous movement, where the little
people shall act themselves out as freely and impulsively as
can consist with the comfort of the whole, and where the
anxious watching and planning for them shall be kept as
secret from them as possible.</p>
<p>It is well that one of the sunniest and airiest rooms in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the house be the children&rsquo;s nursery. It is good philosophy,
too, to furnish it attractively, even if the sum expended
lower the standard of parlor luxuries. It is well that the
children&rsquo;s chamber, which is to act constantly on their impressible
natures for years, should command a better prospect,
a sunnier aspect, than one which serves for a day&rsquo;s occupancy
of the transient guest. It is well that journeys should
be made or put off in view of the interests of the children;
that guests should be invited with a view to their improvement;
that some intimacies should be chosen and some rejected
on their account. But it is not well that all this
should, from infancy, be daily talked out before the child,
and he grow up in egotism from moving in a sphere where
everything from first to last is calculated and arranged with
reference to himself. A little appearance of wholesome
neglect combined with real care and never ceasing watchfulness
has often seemed to do wonders in this work of setting
human beings on their own feet for the life journey.</p>
<p>Education is the highest object of home, but education in
the widest sense,&mdash;education of the parents no less than of
the children. In a true home the man and the woman receive,
through their cares, their watchings, their hospitality,
their charity, the last and highest finish that earth can put
upon them. From that they must pass upward, for earth
can teach them no more.</p>
<p>The home education is incomplete unless it include the
idea of hospitality and charity. Hospitality is a Biblical
and apostolic virtue, and not so often recommended in Holy
Writ without reason. Hospitality is much neglected in
America for the very reasons touched upon above. We
have received our ideas of propriety and elegance of living
from old countries, where labor is cheap, where domestic
service is a well-understood, permanent occupation, adopted
cheerfully for life, and where of course there is such a subdivision
of labor as insures great thoroughness in all its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
branches. We are ashamed or afraid to conform honestly
and hardily to a state of things purely American. We have
not yet accomplished what our friend the Doctor calls &ldquo;our
weaning,&rdquo; and learned that dinners with circuitous courses
and divers other Continental and English refinements, well
enough in their way, cannot be accomplished in families
with two or three untrained servants, without an expense
of care and anxiety which makes them heart-withering to
the delicate wife, and too severe a trial to occur often.
America is the land of subdivided fortunes, of a general
average of wealth and comfort, and there ought to be, therefore,
an understanding in the social basis far more simple
than in the Old World.</p>
<p>Many families of small fortunes know this,&mdash;they are
quietly living so,&mdash;but they have not the steadiness to
share their daily average living with a friend, a traveler, or
guest, just as the Arab shares his tent and the Indian his
bowl of succotash. They cannot have company, they say.
Why? Because it is such a fuss to get out the best things,
and then to put them back again. But why get out the
best things! Why not give your friend what he would
like a thousand times better,&mdash;a bit of your average home
life, a seat at any time at your board, a seat at your fire?
If he sees that there is a handle off your teacup, and that
there is a crack across one of your plates, he only thinks,
with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;Well, mine aren&rsquo;t the only things
that meet with accidents,&rdquo; and he feels nearer to you ever
after; he will let you come to his table and see the cracks
in his teacups, and you will condole with each other on the
transient nature of earthly possessions. If it become apparent
in these entirely undressed rehearsals that your children
are sometimes disorderly, and that your cook sometimes
overdoes the meat, and that your second girl sometimes is
awkward in waiting, or has forgotten a table propriety, your
friend only feels, &ldquo;Ah, well, other people have trials as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
well as I,&rdquo; and he thinks, if you come to see him, he shall
feel easy with you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having company&rdquo; is an expense that may always be
felt; but easy daily hospitality, the plate always on your
table for a friend, is an expense that appears on no accounts
book, and a pleasure that is daily and constant.</p>
<p>Under this head of hospitality, let us suppose a case.
A traveler comes from England; he comes in good faith
and good feeling to see how Americans live. He merely
wants to penetrate into the interior of domestic life, to see
what there is genuinely and peculiarly American about it.
Now here is Smilax, who is living, in a small, neat way,
on his salary from the daily press. He remembers hospitalities
received from our traveler in England, and wants to
return them. He remembers, too, with dismay, a well-kept
establishment, the well-served table, the punctilious, orderly
servants. Smilax keeps two, a cook and chambermaid, who
divide the functions of his establishment between them.
What shall he do? Let him say, in a fair, manly way,
&ldquo;My dear fellow, I&rsquo;m delighted to see you. I live in a
small way, but I&rsquo;ll do my best for you, and Mrs. Smilax
will be delighted. Come and dine with us, so and so, and
we&rsquo;ll bring in one or two friends.&rdquo; So the man comes, and
Mrs. Smilax serves up such a dinner as lies within the
limits of her knowledge and the capacities of her servants.
All plain, good of its kind, unpretending, without an attempt
to do anything English or French,&mdash;to do anything
more than if she were furnishing a gala dinner for her father
or returned brother. Show him your house freely, just as
it is, talk to him freely of it, just as he in England showed
you his larger house and talked to you of his finer things.
If the man is a true man, he will thank you for such unpretending,
sincere welcome; if he is a man of straw, then he
is not worth wasting Mrs. Smilax&rsquo;s health and spirits for, in
unavailing efforts to get up a foreign dinner-party.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>A man who has any heart in him values a genuine, little
bit of home more than anything else you can give him.
He can get French cooking at a restaurant; he can buy expensive
wines at first-class hotels, if he wants them; but the
traveler, though ever so rich and ever so well-served at
home, is, after all, nothing but a man as you are, and he is
craving something that doesn&rsquo;t seem like an hotel,&mdash;some
bit of real, genuine heart life. Perhaps he would like better
than anything to show you the last photograph of his
wife, or to read to you the great, round-hand letter of his
ten-year-old which he has got to-day. He is ready to cry
when he thinks of it. In this mood he goes to see you,
hoping for something like, home, and you first receive him
in a parlor opened only on state occasions, and that has been
circumstantially and exactly furnished, as the upholsterer
assures you, as every other parlor of the kind in the city is
furnished. You treat him to a dinner got up for the occasion,
with hired waiters,&mdash;a dinner which it has taken Mrs.
Smilax a week to prepare for, and will take her a week to
recover from,&mdash;for which the baby has been snubbed and
turned off, to his loud indignation, and your young four-year-old
sent to his aunts. Your traveler eats your dinner,
and finds it inferior, as a work of art, to other dinners,&mdash;a
poor imitation. He goes away and criticises; you hear of
it, and resolve never to invite a foreigner again. But if
you had given him a little of your heart, a little home
warmth and feeling,&mdash;if you had shown him your baby,
and let him romp with your four-year-old, and eat a genuine
dinner with you,&mdash;would he have been false to that? Not
so likely. He wanted something real and human,&mdash;you
gave him a bad dress rehearsal, and dress rehearsals always
provoke criticism.</p>
<p>Besides hospitality, there is, in a true home, a mission of
charity. It is a just law which regulates the possession of
great or beautiful works of art in the Old World, that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
shall in some sense be considered the property of all who
can appreciate. Fine grounds have hours when the public
may be admitted; pictures and statues may be shown to
visitors: and this is a noble charity. In the same manner
the fortunate individuals who have achieved the greatest of
all human works of art should employ it as a sacred charity.
How many, morally wearied, wandering, disabled, are healed
and comforted by the warmth of a true home! When a
mother has sent her son to the temptations of a distant
city, what news is so glad to her heart as that he has found
some quiet family where he visits often and is made to feel
at <span class='smcap'>home</span>? How many young men have good women saved
from temptation and shipwreck by drawing them often to
the sheltered corner by the fireside! The poor artist;
the wandering genius who has lost his way in this world,
and stumbles like a child among hard realities; the many
men and women who, while they have houses, have no
homes, see from afar, in their distant, bleak life journey,
the light of a true home fire, and, if made welcome there,
warm their stiffened limbs, and go forth stronger to their
pilgrimage. Let those who have accomplished this beautiful
and perfect work of divine art be liberal of its influence.
Let them not seek to bolt the doors and draw the
curtains; for they know not, and will never know till the
future life, of the good they may do by the ministration of
this great charity of home.</p>
<p>We have heard much lately of the restricted sphere of
woman. We have been told how many spirits among women
are of a wider, stronger, more heroic mould than befits
the mere routine of housekeeping. It may be true that
there are many women far too great, too wise, too high, for
mere housekeeping. But where is the woman in any way
too great, or too high, or too wise, to spend herself in creating
a home? What can any woman make diviner, higher,
better? From such homes go forth all heroisms, all inspirations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
all great deeds. Such mothers and such homes
have made the heroes and martyrs, faithful unto death, who
have given their precious lives to us during these three
years of our agony!</p>
<p>Homes are the work of art peculiar to the genius of woman.
Man helps in this work, but woman leads; the hive
is always in confusion without the queen bee. But what a
woman must she be who does this work perfectly! She
comprehends all, she balances and arranges all; all different
tastes and temperaments find in her their rest, and she can
unite at one hearthstone the most discordant elements. In
her is order, yet an order ever veiled and concealed by indulgence.
None are checked, reproved, abridged of privileges
by her love of system; for she knows that order was
made for the family, and not the family for order. Quietly
she takes on herself what all others refuse or overlook.
What the unwary disarrange she silently rectifies. Everybody
in her sphere breathes easy, feels free; and the driest
twig begins in her sunshine to put out buds and blossoms.
So quiet are her operations and movements that
none sees that it is she who holds all things in harmony;
only, alas, when she is gone, how many things suddenly
appear disordered, inharmonious, neglected! All these
threads have been smilingly held in her weak hand. Alas,
if that is no longer there!</p>
<p>Can any woman be such a housekeeper without inspiration?
No. In the words of the old church service, &ldquo;her
soul must ever have affiance in God.&rdquo; The New Jerusalem
of a perfect home cometh down from God out of heaven.
But to make such a home is ambition high and worthy
enough for any woman, be she what she may.</p>
<p>One thing more. Right on the threshold of all perfection
lies the cross to be taken up. No one can go over or
around that cross in science or in art. Without labor and
self-denial neither Raphael nor Michel Angelo nor Newton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
was made perfect. Nor can man or woman create a true
home who is not willing in the outset to embrace life heroically
to encounter labor and sacrifice. Only to such
shall this divinest power be given to create on earth that
which is the nearest image of heaven.</p>

<h3>IV <br /><br />THE ECONOMY OF THE BEAUTIFUL</h3>
</div>
<p>Talking to you in this way once a month, O my confidential
reader, there seems to be danger, as in all intervals
of friendship, that we shall not readily be able to take up
our strain of conversation just where we left off. Suffer
me, therefore, to remind you that the month past left us
seated at the fireside, just as we had finished reading of what
a home was, and how to make one.</p>
<p>The fire had burned low, and great, solid hickory coals
were winking dreamily at us from out their fluffy coats of
white ashes,&mdash;just as if some household sprite there were
opening now one eye and then the other, and looking in a
sleepy, comfortable way at us.</p>
<p>The close of my piece about the good house mother had
seemed to tell on my little audience. Marianne had nestled
close to her mother, and laid her head on her knee; and
though Jenny sat up straight as a pin, yet her ever busy
knitting was dropped in her lap, and I saw the glint of a
tear in her quick, sparkling eye,&mdash;yes, actually a little bright
bead fell upon her work; whereupon she started up actively,
and declared that the fire wanted just one more stick to make
a blaze before bedtime; and then there was such a raking
among the coals, such an adjusting of the andirons, such
vigorous arrangement of the wood, and such a brisk whisking
of the hearth-brush, that it was evident Jenny had something
on her mind. When all was done, she sat down again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and looked straight into the blaze, which went dancing and
crackling up, casting glances and flecks of light on our pictures
and books, and making all the old, familiar furniture
seem full of life and motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a good piece,&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;I
think those are things that should be thought about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Jenny was the youngest of our flock, and therefore,
in a certain way, regarded by my wife and me as perennially
&ldquo;the baby;&rdquo; and these little, old-fashioned, decisive ways
of announcing her opinions seemed so much a part of her
nature, so peculiarly &ldquo;Jennyish,&rdquo; as I used to say, that my
wife and I only exchanged amused glances over her head
when they occurred.</p>
<p>In a general way, Jenny, standing in the full orb of her
feminine instincts like Diana in the moon, rather looked
down on all masculine views of women&rsquo;s matters as <i>tolerabiles
inepti&oelig;</i>; but towards her papa she had gracious
turns of being patronizing to the last degree; and one of
these turns was evidently at its flood-tide, as she proceeded
to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> think papa is right,&mdash;that keeping house and having
a home, and all that, is a very serious thing, and that people
go into it with very little thought about it. I really
think those things papa has been saying there ought to be
thought about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I wish you would tell me exactly
how you would spend that money you gave me for
house-furnishing. I should like just your views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Jenny with eagerness; &ldquo;because it is
just as papa says,&mdash;a sensible man, who has thought and
had experience, can&rsquo;t help having some ideas, even about
women&rsquo;s affairs, that are worth attending to. I think so,
decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledged the compliment for my sex and myself
with my best bow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But then, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling
sorry that one can&rsquo;t live in such a way as to have beautiful
things around one. I&rsquo;m sorry they must cost so much, and
take so much care, for I am made so that I really want
them. I do so like to see pretty things! I do like rich
carpets and elegant carved furniture, and fine china and cut-glass
and silver. I can&rsquo;t bear mean, common-looking rooms.
I should so like to have my house look beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house ought not to look mean and common,&mdash;your
house ought to look beautiful,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It would
be a sin and a shame to have it otherwise. No house ought
to be fitted up for a future home without a strong and a
leading reference to beauty in all its arrangements. If I
were a Greek, I should say that the first household libation
should be made to beauty; but, being an old-fashioned
Christian, I would say that he who prepares a home with
no eye to beauty neglects the example of the great Father
who has filled our earth home with such elaborate ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, papa, there&rsquo;s the money!&rdquo; said Jenny,
shaking her little head wisely. &ldquo;You men don&rsquo;t think of
that. You want us girls, for instance, to be patterns of
economy, but we must always be wearing fresh, nice things;
you abhor soiled gloves and worn shoes; and yet how is
all this to be done without money? And it&rsquo;s just so in
housekeeping. You sit in your armchairs, and conjure up
visions of all sorts of impossible things to be done; but
when mamma there takes out that little account-book, and
figures away on the cost of things, where do the visions go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, my little dear, and you talk just like
a woman,&rdquo;&mdash;this was my only way of revenging myself;
&ldquo;that is to say, you jump to conclusions, without sufficient
knowledge. I maintain that in house-furnishing, as
well as woman-furnishing, there&rsquo;s nothing so economical as
beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of papa&rsquo;s paradoxes!&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is my thesis, which I shall nail up
over the mantelpiece there, as Luther nailed his to the
church door. It is time to rake up the fire now; but to-morrow
night I will give you a paper on the Economy of
the Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Come, now we are to have papa&rsquo;s paradox,&rdquo; said Jenny,
as soon as the tea-things had been carried out.</p>
<p><i>Entre nous</i>, I must tell you that insensibly we had fallen
into the habit of taking our tea by my study fire. Tea, you
know, is a mere nothing in itself, its only merit being its
social and poetic associations, its warmth and fragrance;
and the more socially and informally it can be dispensed,
the more in keeping with its airy and cheerful nature.</p>
<p>Our circle was enlightened this evening by the cheery
visage of Bob Stephens, seated, as of right, close to Marianne&rsquo;s
work-basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Bob,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;papa has undertaken to
prove that the most beautiful things are always the cheapest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s a carved
antique bookcase and study-table that I have my eye on, and
if this can in any way be made to appear&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t be made to appear,&rdquo; said Jenny, settling
herself at her knitting, &ldquo;only in some transcendental, poetic
sense, such as papa can always make out. Papa is more
than half a poet, and his truths turn out to be figures of
rhetoric when one comes to apply them to matters of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Jenny, please remember my subject and
thesis,&rdquo; I replied,&mdash;&ldquo;that in house-furnishing there is nothing
so economical as beauty; and I will make it good
against all comers, not by figures of rhetoric, but by figures
of arithmetic. I am going to be very matter-of-fact and
commonplace in my details, and keep ever in view the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
addition table. I will instance a case which has occurred
under my own observation.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>THE ECONOMY OF THE BEAUTIFUL</h4>
<p>Two of the houses lately built on the new land in Boston
were bought by two friends, Philip and John. Philip had
plenty of money, and paid the cash down for his house,
without feeling the slightest vacancy in his pocket. John,
who was an active, rising young man, just entering on a
flourishing business, had expended all his moderate savings
for years in the purchase of his dwelling, and still had a
mortgage remaining, which he hoped to clear off by his
future successes. Philip begins the work of furnishing as
people do with whom money is abundant, and who have
simply to go from shop to shop and order all that suits their
fancy and is considered &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; in good society. John
begins to furnish with very little money. He has a wife
and two little ones, and he wisely deems that to insure to
them a well-built house, in an open, airy situation, with conveniences
for warming, bathing, and healthy living, is a wise
beginning in life; but it leaves him little or nothing beyond.</p>
<p>Behold, then, Philip and his wife, well pleased, going the
rounds of shops and stores in fitting up their new dwelling,
and let us follow step by step. To begin with the wall-paper.
Imagine a front and back parlor, with folding-doors,
with two south windows on the front, and two looking on
a back court, after the general manner of city houses. We
will suppose they require about thirty rolls of wall-paper.
Philip buys the heaviest French velvet, with gildings and
traceries, at four dollars a roll. This, by the time it has
been put on, with gold mouldings, according to the most
established taste of the best paper-hangers, will bring the
wall-paper of the two rooms to a figure something like two
hundred dollars. Now they proceed to the carpet stores,
and there are thrown at their feet by obsequious clerks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
velvets and Axminsters, with flowery convolutions and
medallion centres, as if the flower gardens of the tropics
were whirling in waltzes, with graceful lines of arabesque,&mdash;roses,
callas, lilies, knotted, wreathed, twined, with blue
and crimson and golden ribbons, dazzling marvels of color
and tracery. There is no restraint in price,&mdash;four or six
dollars a yard, it is all the same to them,&mdash;and soon a
magic flower garden blooms on the floors, at a cost of five
hundred dollars. A pair of elegant rugs, at fifty dollars
apiece, complete the inventory, and bring our rooms to the
mark of eight hundred dollars for papering and carpeting
alone. Now come the great mantel-mirrors for four hundred
more, and our rooms progress. Then comes the upholsterer,
and measures our four windows, that he may skillfully barricade
them from air and sunshine. The fortifications against
heaven, thus prepared, cost, in the shape of damask, cord,
tassels, shades, laces, and cornices, about two hundred dollars
per window. To be sure, they make the rooms close and
sombre as the grave, but they are of the most splendid
stuffs; and if the sun would only reflect, he would see,
himself, how foolish it was for him to try to force himself
into a window guarded by his betters. If there is anything
cheap and plebeian, it is sunshine and fresh air! Behold us,
then, with our two rooms papered, carpeted, and curtained
for two thousand dollars; and now are to be put in them
sofas, lounges, étagères, centre-tables, screens, chairs of every
pattern and device, for which it is but moderate to allow a
thousand more. We have now two parlors furnished at an
outlay of three thousand dollars, without a single picture, a
single article of statuary, a single object of art of any kind,
and without any light to see them by if they were there.
We must say for our Boston upholsterers and furniture-makers
that such good taste generally reigns in their establishments
that rooms furnished at haphazard from them
cannot fail of a certain air of good taste, so far as the individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
things are concerned. But the different articles we
have supposed, having been ordered without reference to
one another or the rooms, have, when brought together, no
unity of effect, and the general result is scattering and confused.
If asked how Philip&rsquo;s parlors look, your reply is,
&ldquo;Oh, the usual way of such parlors,&mdash;everything that such
people usually get,&mdash;medallion carpets, carved furniture,
great mirrors, bronze mantel ornaments, and so on.&rdquo; The
only impression a stranger receives, while waiting in the
dim twilight of these rooms, is that their owner is rich, and
able to get good, handsome things, such as all other rich
people get.</p>
<p>Now our friend John, as often happens in America, is
moving in the same social circle with Philip, visiting the
same people,&mdash;his house is the twin of the one Philip has
been furnishing,&mdash;and how shall he, with a few hundred
dollars, make his rooms even presentable beside those which
Philip has fitted up elegantly at three thousand?</p>
<p>Now for the economy of beauty. Our friend must make
his prayer to the Graces,&mdash;for, if they cannot save him,
nobody can. One thing John has to begin with, that rare
gift to man, a wife with the magic cestus of Venus,&mdash;not
around her waist, but, if such a thing could be, in her
finger-ends. All that she touches falls at once into harmony
and proportion. Her eye for color and form is intuitive:
let her arrange a garret, with nothing but boxes,
barrels, and cast-off furniture in it, and ten to one she makes
it seem the most attractive place in the house. It is a
veritable &ldquo;gift of good faërie,&rdquo; this tact of beautifying and
arranging, that some women have; and, on the present occasion,
it has a real, material value, that can be estimated
in dollars and cents. Come with us and you can see the
pair taking their survey of the yet unfurnished parlors, as
busy and happy as a couple of bluebirds picking up the first
sticks and straws for their nest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There are two sunny windows to begin with,&rdquo; says the
good fairy, with an appreciative glance. &ldquo;That insures
flowers all winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says John; &ldquo;I never would look at a house
without a good sunny exposure. Sunshine is the best ornament
of a house, and worth an extra thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for our wall-paper,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Have you looked
at wall-papers, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we shall get very pretty ones for thirty-seven
cents a roll; all you want of a paper, you know, is to make
a ground-tint to throw out your pictures and other matters,
and to reflect a pleasant tone of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, John, you know Uncle James says that a stone
color is the best, but I can&rsquo;t bear those cold blue grays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; says John. &ldquo;If we must have gray, let it at
least be a gray suffused with gold or rose color, such as you
see at evening in the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think,&rdquo; responds she; &ldquo;but, better, I should like
a paper with a tone of buff,&mdash;something that produces
warm yellowish reflections, and will almost make you think
the sun is shining in cold gray weather; and then there is
nothing that lights up so cheerfully in the evening. In
short, John, I think the color of a <i>zafferano</i> rose will be
just about the shade we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can find that, in good American paper, as I said
before, at from thirty-seven to forty cents a roll. Then
our bordering: there&rsquo;s an important question, for that must
determine the carpet, the chairs, and everything else. Now
what shall be the ground-tint of our rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two to choose between,&rdquo; says the lady,&mdash;&ldquo;green
and maroon: which is the best for the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; says John, looking above the mantelpiece, as
if he saw a picture there,&mdash;&ldquo;I think a border of maroon
velvet, with maroon furniture, is the best for the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and then we will have that
lovely <ins title="Was marroon">maroon</ins> and crimson carpet that I saw at Lowe&rsquo;s;
it is an ingrain, to be sure, but has a Brussels pattern, a
mossy, mixed figure, of different shades of crimson; it has
a good warm, strong color, and when I come to cover the
lounges and our two old armchairs with maroon rep, it
will make such a pretty effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;and then, you know, our picture is
so bright, it will light up the whole. Everything depends
on the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as to &ldquo;the picture,&rdquo; it has a story which must be
told. John, having been all his life a worshiper and adorer
of beauty and beautiful things, had never passed to or from
his business without stopping at the print-shop windows,
and seeing a little of what was there.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions he was smitten to the heart
with the beauty of an autumn landscape, where the red
maples and sumachs, the purple and crimson oaks, all
stood swathed and harmonized together in the hazy Indian
summer atmosphere. There was a great yellow chestnut
tree, on a distant hill, which stood out so naturally that
John instinctively felt his fingers tingling for a basket, and
his heels alive with a desire to bound over on to the rustling
hillside and pick up the glossy brown nuts. Everything
was there of autumn, even to the goldenrod and
purple asters and scarlet creepers in the foreground.</p>
<p>John went in and inquired. It was by an unknown
French artist, without name or patrons, who had just come
to our shores to study our scenery, and this was the first
picture he had exposed for sale. John had just been paid
a quarter&rsquo;s salary; he bethought him of board-bill and
washerwoman, sighed, and faintly offered fifty dollars.</p>
<p>To his surprise he was taken up at once, and the picture
became his. John thought himself dreaming. He examined
his treasure over and over, and felt sure that it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
the work of no amateur beginner, but of a trained hand
and a true artist soul. So he found his way to the studio
of the stranger, and apologized for having got such a gem
for so much less than its worth. &ldquo;It was all I could give,
though,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and one who paid four times as much
could not value it more.&rdquo; And so John took one and
another of his friends, with longer purses than his own,
to the studio of the modest stranger; and now his pieces
command their full worth in the market, and he works with
orders far ahead of his ability to execute, giving to the
canvas the trails of American scenery as appreciated and
felt by the subtile delicacy of the French mind,&mdash;our
rural summer views, our autumn glories, and the dreamy,
misty delicacy of our snowy winter landscapes. Whoso
would know the truth of the same, let him inquire for the
modest studio of Morvillier, at Maiden, scarce a bowshot
from our Boston.</p>
<p>This picture had always been the ruling star of John&rsquo;s
house, his main dependence for brightening up his bachelor
apartments; and when he came to the task of furbishing
those same rooms for a fair occupant, the picture was
still his mine of gold. For a picture painted by a real
artist, who studies Nature minutely and conscientiously,
has something of the charm of the good Mother herself,&mdash;something
of her faculty of putting on different aspects
under different lights. John and his wife had studied
their picture at all hours of the day: they had seen how
it looked when the morning sun came aslant the scarlet
maples and made a golden shimmer over the blue mountains,
how it looked toned down in the cool shadows of
afternoon, and how it warmed up in the sunset and died
off mysteriously into the twilight; and now, when larger
parlors were to be furnished, the picture was still the tower
of strength, the rallying-point of their hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, John,&rdquo; said the wife, hesitating, &ldquo;I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
really in doubt whether we shall not have to get at least a
few new chairs and a sofa for our parlors? They are putting
in such splendid things at the other door that I am
positively ashamed of ours; the fact is, they look almost
disreputable,&mdash;like a heap of rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John, laughing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose all together
sent to an auction-room would bring us fifty dollars,
and yet, such as they are, they answer the place of better
things for us; and the fact is, Mary, the hard impassable
barrier in the case is that there really is no money to get
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, then, if there isn&rsquo;t, we must see what we
can do with these, and summon all the good fairies to our
aid,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your little cabinet-maker, John,
will look over the things and furbish them up; there&rsquo;s
that broken arm of the chair must be mended, and everything
re-varnished; then I have found such a lovely rep,
of just the richest shade of maroon, inclining to crimson,
and when we come to cover the lounges and armchairs and
sofas and ottomans all alike, you know they will be quite
another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust you for that, Mary! By the bye, I&rsquo;ve found
a nice little woman, who has worked on upholstery, who
will come in by the day, and be the hands that shall execute
the decrees of your taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure we shall get on capitally. Do you
know that I&rsquo;m almost glad we can&rsquo;t get new things? It&rsquo;s
a sort of enterprise to see what we can do with old ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you see, Mary,&rdquo; said John, seating himself on a
lime-cask which the plasterers had left, and taking out his
memorandum-book,&mdash;&ldquo;you see, I&rsquo;ve calculated this thing
all over; I&rsquo;ve found a way by which I can make our
rooms beautiful and attractive without a cent expended on
new furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my way is short and simple. We must put
things into our rooms that people will look at, so that they
will forget to look at the furniture, and never once trouble
their heads about it. People never look at furniture so
long as there is anything else to look at; just as Napoleon,
when away on one of his expeditions, being told that the
French populace were getting disaffected, wrote back, &lsquo;Gild
the <i>dome des Invalides</i>,&rsquo; and so they gilded it, and the people,
looking at that, forgot everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not clear yet,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;what is coming
of this rhetoric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mary, I&rsquo;ll tell you. A suit of new carved
black-walnut furniture, severe in taste and perfect in style,
such as I should choose at David &amp; Saul&rsquo;s, could not be
got under three hundred dollars, and I haven&rsquo;t the three
hundred to give. What, then, shall we do? We must fall
back on our resources; we must look over our treasures.
We have our proof cast of the great glorious head of the
Venus di Milo; we have those six beautiful photographs of
Rome, that Brown brought to us; we have the great German
lithograph of the San Sisto Mother and Child, and we
have the two angel heads, from the same; we have that
lovely golden twilight sketch of Heade&rsquo;s; we have some
sea photographs of Bradford&rsquo;s; we have an original pen-and-ink
sketch by Billings; and then, as before, we have &lsquo;our
picture.&rsquo; What has been the use of our watching at the gates
and waiting at the doors of Beauty all our lives, if she hasn&rsquo;t
thrown us out a crust now and then, so that we might have
it for time of need? Now, you see, Mary, we must make
the toilet of our rooms just as a pretty woman makes hers
when money runs low, and she sorts and freshens her ribbons,
and matches them to her hair and eyes, and, with a
bow here and a bit of fringe there, and a button somewhere
else, dazzles us into thinking that she has an infinity of
beautiful attire. Our rooms are new and pretty of themselves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
to begin with; the tint of the paper, and the rich
coloring of the border, corresponding with the furniture and
carpets, will make them seem prettier. And now for arrangement.
Take this front room. I propose to fill those
two recesses each side of the fireplace with my books, in
their plain pine cases, just breast-high from the floor: they
are stained a good dark color, and nobody need stick a pin
in them to find out that they are not rosewood. The top
of these shelves on either side to be covered with the same
stuff as the furniture, finished with a crimson fringe. On
top of the shelves on one side of the fireplace I shall set our
noble Venus di Milo, and I shall buy at Cicci&rsquo;s the lovely
Clytie, and put it the other side. Then I shall get of Williams
&amp; Everett two of their chromo lithographs, which
give you all the style and charm of the best English watercolor
school. I will have the lovely Bay of Amalfi over my
Venus, because she came from those suns and skies of southern
Italy, and I will hang Lake Como over my Clytie.
Then, in the middle, over the fireplace, shall be &lsquo;our picture.&rsquo;
Over each door shall hang one of the lithographed
angel heads of the San Sisto, to watch our going out and
coming in; and the glorious Mother and Child shall hang
opposite the Venus di Milo, to show how Greek and Christian
unite in giving the noblest type to womanhood. And
then, when we have all our sketches and lithographs framed
and hung here and there, and your flowers blooming as they
always do, and your ivies wandering and rambling as they
used to, and hanging in the most graceful ways and places,
and all those little shells and ferns and vases, which you are
always conjuring with, tastefully arranged, I&rsquo;ll venture to
say that our rooms will be not only pleasant, but beautiful,
and that people will oftener say, &lsquo;How beautiful!&rsquo; when
they enter, than if we spent three times the money on new
furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of a year after this conversation, one and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
another of my acquaintances were often heard speaking of
John Morton&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Such beautiful rooms,&mdash;so charmingly
furnished,&mdash;you must go and see them. What does
make them so much pleasanter than those rooms in the
other house, which have everything in them that money can
buy?&rdquo; So said the folk; for nine people out of ten only
feel the effect of a room, and never analyze the causes from
which it flows: they know that certain rooms seem dull and
heavy and confused, but they don&rsquo;t know why; that certain
others seem cheerful, airy, and beautiful, but they know not
why. The first exclamation, on entering John&rsquo;s parlors, was
so often &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; that it became rather a byword
in the family. Estimated by their mere money value,
the articles in the rooms were of very trifling worth; but, as
they stood arranged and combined, they had all the effect of
a lovely picture. Although the statuary was only plaster,
and the photographs and lithographs such as were all within
the compass of limited means, yet every one of them was a
good thing of its own kind, or a good reminder of some of
the greatest works of art. A good plaster cast is a daguerreotype,
so to speak, of a great statue, though it may be
bought for five or six dollars, while its original is not to be
had for any namable sum. A chromo lithograph of the best
sort gives all the style and manner and effect of Turner or
Stanfield, or any of the best of modern artists, though you
buy it for five or ten dollars, and though the original would
command a thousand guineas. The lithographs from Raphael&rsquo;s
immortal picture give you the results of a whole
age of artistic culture, in a form within the compass of very
humble means. There is now selling for five dollars at
Williams &amp; Everett&rsquo;s a photograph of Cheney&rsquo;s crayon
drawing of the San Sisto Madonna and Child, which has the
very spirit of the glorious original. Such a picture, hung
against the wall of a child&rsquo;s room, would train its eye from
infancy; and yet how many will freely spend five dollars in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
embroidery on its dress, that say they cannot afford works
of art!</p>
<p>There was one advantage which John and his wife found,
in the way in which they furnished their house, that I have
hinted at before: it gave freedom to their children. Though
their rooms were beautiful, it was not with the tantalizing
beauty of expensive and frail knick-knacks. Pictures
hung against the wall, and statuary safely lodged on brackets,
speak constantly to the childish eye, but are out of
the reach of childish fingers, and are not upset by childish
romps. They are not, like china and crystal, liable to be
used and abused by servants; they do not wear out; they
are not spoiled by dust, nor consumed by moths. The
beauty once there is always there; though the mother be
ill and in her chamber, she has no fears that she shall find it
all wrecked and shattered. And this style of beauty, inexpensive
as it is, compared with luxurious furniture, is a
means of cultivation. No child is ever stimulated to draw
or to read by an Axminster carpet or a carved centre-table;
but a room surrounded with photographs and pictures and
fine casts suggests a thousand inquiries, stimulates the little
eye and hand. The child is found with its pencil, drawing,
or he asks for a book on Venice, or wants to hear the history
of the Roman Forum.</p>
<p>But I have made my article too long. I will write
another on the moral and intellectual effects of house-furnishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have proved my point, Miss Jenny, have I not?
<i>In house-furnishing nothing is more economical than
beauty.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h3>V <br /><br />RAKING UP THE FIRE</h3>
</div>
<p>We have a custom at our house which we call <i>raking up
the fire</i>. That is to say, the last half hour before bedtime,
we draw in, shoulder to shoulder, around the last brands
and embers of our hearth, which we prick up and brighten,
and dispose for a few farewell flickers and glimmers. This
is a grand time for discussion. Then we talk over parties,
if the young people have been out of an evening,&mdash;a book,
if we have been reading one; we discuss and analyze characters,&mdash;give
our views on all subjects, &aelig;sthetic, theological,
and scientific, in a way most wonderful to hear; and, in
fact, we sometimes get so engaged in our discussions that
every spark of the fire burns out, and we begin to feel ourselves
shivering around the shoulders, before we can remember
that it is bedtime.</p>
<p>So, after the reading of my last article, we had a &ldquo;raking-up
talk,&rdquo;&mdash;to wit, Jenny, Marianne, and I, with Bob
Stephens: my wife, still busy at her work-basket, sat at
the table a little behind us. Jenny, of course, opened the
ball in her usual incisive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, papa, after all you say in your piece there, I
cannot help feeling that, if I had the taste and the money
too, it would be better than the taste alone with no money.
I like the nice arrangements and the books and the drawings,
but I think all these would appear better still with
really elegant furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doubts that?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Give me a large tub of
gold coin to dip into, and the furnishing and beautifying
of a house is a simple affair. The same taste that could
make beauty out of cents and dimes could make it more
abundantly out of dollars and eagles. But I have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
speaking for those who have not and cannot get riches, and
who wish to have agreeable houses; and I begin in the
outset by saying that beauty is a thing to be respected,
reverenced, and devoutly cared for, and then I say that
<span class='smcaplc'>BEAUTY IS CHEAP</span>,&mdash;nay, to put it so that the shrewdest
Yankee will understand it,&mdash;<span class='smcap'>BEAUTY IS THE CHEAPEST
THING YOU CAN HAVE</span>, because in many ways it is a substitute
for expense. A few vases of flowers in a room, a
few blooming, well-kept plants, a few prints framed in
fanciful frames of cheap domestic fabric, a statuette, a
bracket, an engraving, a pencil-sketch,&mdash;above all, a few
choice books,&mdash;all these arranged by a woman who has the
gift in her finger-ends, often produce such an illusion on
the mind&rsquo;s eye that one goes away without once having
noticed that the cushion of the armchair was worn out, and
that some veneering had fallen off the centre-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a friend, a schoolmistress, who lives in a poor
little cottage enough, which, let alone of the Graces, might
seem mean and sordid, but a few flower-seeds and a little
weeding in the spring make it, all summer, an object which
everybody stops to look at. Her &aelig;sthetic soul was at first
greatly tried with the water-barrel which stood under the
eaves spout,&mdash;a most necessary evil, since only thus could
her scanty supply of soft water for domestic purposes be
secured. One of the Graces, however, suggested to her
a happy thought. She planted a row of morning-glories
round the bottom of her barrel, and drove a row of tacks
around the top, and strung her water-butt with twine, like
a great harpsichord. A few weeks covered the twine with
blossoming plants, which every morning were a mass of
many-colored airy blooms, waving in graceful sprays, and
looking at themselves in the water. The water-barrel, in
fact, became a celebrated stroke of ornamental gardening,
which the neighbors came to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;everybody hasn&rsquo;t mamma&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
faculty with flowers. Flowers will grow for some people,
and for some they won&rsquo;t. Nobody can see what mamma
does so very much, but her plants always look fresh and
thriving and healthy,&mdash;her things blossom just when she
wants them, and do anything else she wishes them to; and
there are other people that fume and fuss and try, and their
things won&rsquo;t do anything at all. There&rsquo;s Aunt Easygo
has plant after plant brought from the greenhouse, and
hanging-baskets, and all sorts of things; but her plants
grow yellow and drop their leaves, and her hanging-baskets
get dusty and poverty-stricken, while mamma&rsquo;s go on flourishing
as heart could desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you what your mother puts into her plants,&rdquo;
said I,&mdash;&ldquo;just what she has put into her children, and all
her other home-things,&mdash;her <i>heart</i>. She loves them; she
lives in them; she has in herself a plant-life and a plant-sympathy.
She feels for them as if she herself were a
plant; she anticipates their wants,&mdash;always remembers
them without an effort, and so the care flows to them daily
and hourly. She hardly knows when she does the things
that make them grow, but she gives them a minute a hundred
times a day. She moves this nearer the glass,&mdash;draws
that back,&mdash;detects some thief of a worm on one,&mdash;digs
at the root of another, to see why it droops,&mdash;washes
these leaves and sprinkles those,&mdash;waters, and refrains
from watering, all with the habitual care of love. Your
mother herself doesn&rsquo;t know why her plants grow; it
takes a philosopher and a writer for the &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo; to tell
her what the cause is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I saw my wife laughing over her work-basket as
she answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, one of these days <i>I</i> will write an article for the
&lsquo;Atlantic,&rsquo; that your papa need not have <i>all</i> the say to himself;
however, I believe he has hit the nail on the head
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he has,&rdquo; said Marianne. &ldquo;But, mamma, I
am afraid to begin to depend much on plants for the beauty
of my rooms, for fear I should not have your gift,&mdash;and,
of all forlorn and hopeless things in a room, ill-kept plants
are the most so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not recommend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a young housekeeper,
just beginning, to rest much for her home ornament
on plant-keeping, unless she has an experience of her
own love and talent in this line which makes her sure of
success; for plants will not thrive if they are forgotten or
overlooked, and only tended in occasional intervals; and,
as Marianne says, neglected plants are the most forlorn of
all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne anxiously, &ldquo;there, in those
patent parlors of John&rsquo;s that you wrote of, flowers acted a
great part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The charm of those parlors of John&rsquo;s may be chemically
analyzed,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In the first place, there is sunshine,
a thing that always affects the human nerves of happiness.
Why else is it that people are always so glad to
see the sun after a long storm? why are bright days matters
of such congratulation? Sunshine fills a house with
a thousand beautiful and fanciful effects of light and shade,&mdash;with
soft, luminous, reflected radiances, that give picturesque
effects to the pictures, books, statuettes of an interior.
John, happily, had no money to buy brocatelle curtains,
and, besides this, he loved sunshine too much to buy them,
if he could. He had been enough with artists to know
that heavy damask curtains darken precisely that part of the
window where the light proper for pictures and statuary
should come in, namely, the upper part. The fashionable
system of curtains lights only the legs of the chairs and the
carpets, and leaves all the upper portion of the room in
shadow. John&rsquo;s windows have shades which can at pleasure
be drawn down from the top or up from the bottom,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
so that the best light to be had may always be arranged for
his little interior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;in your chemical analysis
of John&rsquo;s rooms, what is the next thing to the sunshine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is harmony of color. The wall-paper,
the furniture, the carpets, are of tints that harmonize
with one another. This is a grace in rooms always,
and one often neglected. The French have an expressive
phrase with reference to articles which are out of accord,&mdash;they
say that they swear at each other, I have been in
rooms where I seemed to hear the wall-paper swearing at
the carpet, and the carpet swearing back at the wall-paper,
and each article of furniture swearing at the rest. These
appointments may all of them be of the most expensive
kind, but with such dis-harmony no arrangement can ever
produce anything but a vulgar and disagreeable effect. On
the other hand, I have been in rooms where all the material
was cheap and the furniture poor, but where, from some instinctive
knowledge of the reciprocal effect of colors, everything
was harmonious, and produced a sense of elegance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recollect once traveling on a Western canal through
a long stretch of wilderness, and stopping to spend the
night at an obscure settlement of a dozen houses. We
were directed to lodgings in a common frame house at a
little distance, where, it seemed, the only hotel was kept.
When we entered the parlor, we were struck with utter
amazement at its prettiness, which affected us before we
began to ask ourselves how it came to be pretty. It was,
in fact, only one of the miracles of harmonious color working
with very simple materials. Some woman had been
busy there, who had both eyes and fingers. The sofa, the
common wooden rocking-chairs, and some ottomans, probably
made of old soap-boxes, were all covered with American
nankeen of a soft yellowish-brown, with a bordering of
blue print. The window-shades, the table-cover, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
piano-cloth all repeated the same colors, in the same cheap
material. A simple straw matting was laid over the floor,
and, with a few books, a vase of flowers, and one or two
prints, the room had a home-like and even elegant air, that
struck us all the more forcibly from its contrast with the
usual tawdry, slovenly style of such parlors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The means used for getting up this effect were the
most inexpensive possible,&mdash;simply the following out, in
cheap material, a law of uniformity and harmony, which
always will produce beauty. In the same manner, I have
seen a room furnished, whose effect was really gorgeous in
color, where the only materials used were Turkey-red cotton
and a simple ingrain carpet of corresponding color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you girls have been busy lately in schemes for
buying a velvet carpet for the new parlor that is to be, and
the only points that have seemed to weigh in the council
were that it was velvet, that it was cheaper than velvets
usually are, and that it was a genteel pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;what ears you have! We
thought you were reading all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are going to say,&rdquo; said Marianne.
&ldquo;You think that we have not once mentioned the consideration
which should determine the carpet, whether it
will harmonize with our other things. But you see, papa,
we don&rsquo;t really know what our other things are to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;and Aunt Easygo said it was an
unusually good chance to get a velvet carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, good as the chance is, it costs just twice as much
as an ingrain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa, it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are not sure that the effect of it, after you
get it down, will be as good as a well-chosen ingrain one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Marianne reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;Aunt Easygo said she
never heard of such a bargain; only think, two dollars a
yard for a <i>velvet</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And why is it two dollars a yard? Is the man a personal
friend, that he wishes to make you a present of a
dollar on the yard, or is there some reason why it is undesirable?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, papa, he said those large patterns
were not so salable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I never did like
the pattern exactly; as to uniformity of tint, it might
match with anything, for there&rsquo;s every color of the rainbow
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, papa, it&rsquo;s a gorgeous flower-pattern,&rdquo; said
Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Marianne, how many yards of this wonderfully
cheap carpet do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want sixty yards for both rooms,&rdquo; said Jenny,
always primed with statistics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a hundred and twenty dollars,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;and we went over the figures
together, and thought we could make it out by economizing
in other things. Aunt Easygo said that the carpet was
half the battle,&mdash;that it gave the air to everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Marianne, if you want a man&rsquo;s advice in the
case, mine is at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I want, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my dear, choose your wall-papers and borderings,
and, when they are up, choose an ingrain carpet to
harmonize with them, and adapt your furniture to the same
idea. The sixty dollars that you save on your carpet spend
on engravings, chromo lithographs, or photographs of some
good works of art, to adorn your walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your papa may seem to be a
sleepy old book-worm, yet he has his eyes open. Do you
think I don&rsquo;t know why my girls have the credit of being
the best-dressed girls on the street?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh papa!&rdquo; cried out both girls in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, that!&rdquo; said Bob, with energy, pulling at his
mustache. &ldquo;Everybody talks about your dress, and wonders
how you make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I presume you do not go into a shop
and buy a yard of ribbon because it is selling at half price,
and put it on without considering complexion, eyes, hair,
and shade of the dress, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; chimed in the duo with energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t. Haven&rsquo;t I seen you mincing
downstairs, with all your colors harmonized, even to your
gloves and gaiters? Now, a room must be dressed as carefully
as a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m convinced,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;that papa knows
how to make rooms prettier than Aunt Easygo; but then
she said this was cheap, because it would outlast two common
carpets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as you pay double price,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that.
Besides, I would rather, in the course of twenty years, have
two nice, fresh ingrain carpets, of just the color and pattern
that suited my rooms, than labor along with one ill-chosen
velvet that harmonized with nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, understand me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am not traducing
velvet or Brussels or Axminster. I admit that more beautiful
effects can be found in those goods than in the humbler
fabrics of the carpet rooms. Nothing would delight me
more than to put an unlimited credit to Marianne&rsquo;s account,
and let her work out the problems of harmonious color in
velvet and damask. All I have to say is, that certain unities
of color, certain general arrangements, will secure very
nearly as good general effects in either material. A library
with a neat, mossy green carpet on the floor, harmonizing
with wall-paper and furniture, looks generally as well, whether
the mossy green is made in Brussels or in ingrain. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the carpet stores, these two materials stand side by side in
the very same pattern, and one is often as good for the purpose
as the other. A lady of my acquaintance, some years
since, employed an artist to decorate her parlors. The
walls being frescoed and tinted to suit his ideal, he immediately
issued his decree that her splendid velvet carpets
must be sent to auction, and others bought of certain colors
harmonizing with the walls. Unable to find exactly
the color and pattern he wanted, he at last had the carpets
woven in a neighboring factory, where, as yet, they had only
the art of weaving ingrains. Thus was the material sacrificed
at once to the harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remarked, in passing, that this was before Bigelow&rsquo;s
mechanical genius had unlocked for America the higher
secrets of carpet-weaving, and made it possible to have one&rsquo;s
desires accomplished in Brussels or velvet. In those days,
English carpet-weavers did not send to America for their
looms, as they now do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now to return to my analysis of John&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing which goes a great way towards giving
them their agreeable air is the books in them. Some people
are fond of treating books as others do children. One
room in the house is selected, and every book driven into it
and kept there. Yet nothing makes a room so home-like,
so companionable, and gives it such an air of refinement, as
the presence of books. They change the aspect of a parlor
from that of a mere reception-room, where visitors perch for
a transient call, and give it the air of a room where one
feels like taking off one&rsquo;s things to stay. It gives the appearance
of permanence and repose and quiet fellowship;
and, next to pictures on the walls, the many-colored bindings
and gildings of books are the most agreeable adornment
of a room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Marianne,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;we have something to
start with, at all events. There are my English Classics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and English Poets, and my uniform editions of Scott and
Thackeray and Macaulay and Prescott and Irving and Longfellow
and Lowell and Hawthorne and Holmes and a host
more. We really have something pretty there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a lucky girl,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to have so much
secured. A girl brought up in a house full of books, always
able to turn to this or that author and look for any
passage or poem when she thinks of it, doesn&rsquo;t know what
a blank a house without books might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;mamma and I were counting
over my treasures the other day. Do you know, I have
one really fine old engraving, that Bob says is quite a genuine
thing; and then there is that pencil-sketch that poor
Schöne made for me the month before he died,&mdash;it is truly
artistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have a couple of capital things of Landseer&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger that your rooms will not be pretty,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;now you are fairly on the right track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I am troubled about one
thing. My love of beauty runs into everything. I want
pretty things for my table; and yet, as you say, servants
are so careless, one cannot use such things freely without
great waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I believe in best china,
to be kept carefully on an upper shelf, and taken down for
high-days and holidays; it may be a superstition, but I believe
in it. It must never be taken out except when the
mistress herself can see that it is safely cared for. My
mother always washed her china herself; and it was a very
pretty social ceremony, after tea was over, while she sat
among us washing her pretty cups, and wiping them on a
fine damask towel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have your best china
and venerate it,&mdash;it is one of the loveliest of domestic superstitions;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
only do not make it a bar to hospitality, and
shrink from having a friend to tea with you, unless you
feel equal to getting up to the high shelf where you keep
it, getting it down, washing, and putting it up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in serving a table, I say, as I said of a house,
beauty is a necessity, and beauty is cheap. Because you
cannot afford beauty in one form, it does not follow that
you cannot have it in another. Because one cannot afford
to keep up a perennial supply of delicate china and crystal,
subject to the accidents of raw, untrained servants, it does
not follow that the every-day table need present a sordid
assortment of articles chosen simply for cheapness, while
the whole capacity of the purse is given to the set forever
locked away for state occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A table-service all of simple white, of graceful forms,
even though not of china, if arranged with care, with snowy,
well-kept table-linen, clear glasses, and bright American
plate in place of solid silver, may be made to look inviting;
add a glass of flowers every day, and your table may
look pretty: and it is far more important that it should
look pretty for the family every day than for company once
in two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell my girls,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;as the result of my
experience, you may have your pretty china and your lovely
fanciful articles for the table only so long as you can take all
the care of them yourselves. As soon as you get tired of
doing this, and put them into the hands of the trustiest servants,
some good, well-meaning creature is sure to break her
heart and your own and your very pet darling china pitcher
all in one and the same minute, and then her frantic despair
leaves you not even the relief of scolding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have become perfectly sure,&rdquo; said I &ldquo;that there are
spiteful little brownies, intent on seducing good women to
sin, who mount guard over the special idols of the china
closet. If you hear a crash, and a loud Irish wail from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the inner depths, you never think of its being a yellow pie-plate,
or that dreadful one-handled tureen that you have
been wishing were broken these five years; no, indeed,&mdash;it
is sure to be the lovely painted china bowl, wreathed with
morning-glories and sweet-peas, or the engraved glass goblet,
with quaint Old English initials. China sacrificed must
be a great means of saintship to women. Pope, I think,
puts it as the crowning grace of his perfect woman that she
is</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mistress of herself though china fall.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be a saint by this time, then,&rdquo; said mamma;
&ldquo;for in the course of my days I have lost so many idols by
breakage, and peculiar accidents that seemed by a special
fatality to befall my prettiest and most irreplaceable things,
that in fact it has come to be a superstitious feeling now
with which I regard anything particularly pretty of a breakable
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;unless one has a great deal of
money, it seems to me that the investment in these pretty
fragilities is rather a poor one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the principle of beauty is never so captivating
as when it presides over the hour of daily meals.
I would have the room where they are served one of the
pleasantest and sunniest in the house. I would have its
coloring cheerful, and there should be companionable pictures
and engravings on the walls. Of all things, I dislike
a room that seems to be kept, like a restaurant, merely to
eat in. I like to see in a dining-room something that betokens
a pleasant sitting-room at other hours. I like there
some books, a comfortable sofa or lounge, and all that should
make it cosy and inviting. The custom in some families,
of adopting for the daily meals one of the two parlors which
a city house furnishes, has often seemed to me a particularly
happy one. You take your meals, then, in an agreeable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
place, surrounded by the little pleasant arrangements of
your daily sitting-room; and after the meal, if the lady of
the house does the honors of her own pretty china herself,
the office may be a pleasant and social one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in regard to your table-service I have my advice
at hand. Invest in pretty table-linen, in delicate napkins,
have your vase of flowers, and be guided by the eye of
taste in the choice and arrangement of even the every-day
table articles, and have no ugly things when you can have
pretty ones by taking a little thought. If you are sore
tempted with lovely china and crystal, too fragile to last,
too expensive to be renewed, turn away to a print-shop and
comfort yourself by hanging around the walls of your dining-room
beauty that will not break or fade, that will meet your
eye from year to year, though plates, tumblers, and teasets
successively vanish. There is my advice for you, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time let me say, in parenthesis, that my
wife, whose weakness is china, informed me that night,
when we were by ourselves, that she was ordering secretly a
teaset as a bridal gift for Marianne every cup of which was
to be exquisitely painted with the wild flowers of America,
from designs of her own,&mdash;a thing, by the by, that can now
be very nicely executed in our country, as one may find by
looking in at our friend Briggs&rsquo;s on School Street. &ldquo;It will
last her all her life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and always be such a pleasure
to look at; and a pretty tea-table is such a pretty
sight!&rdquo; So spoke Mrs. Crowfield, &ldquo;unweaned from china
by a thousand falls.&rdquo; She spoke even with tears in her
eyes. Verily these women are harps of a thousand strings!</p>
<p>But to return to my subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally and lastly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in my analysis and explication
of the agreeableness of those same parlors, comes
the growing grace,&mdash;their <i>homeliness</i>. By &lsquo;homeliness&rsquo; I
mean not ugliness, as the word is apt to be used, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
air that is given to a room by being really at home in
it. Not the most skillful arrangement can impart this
charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that a king of France once remarked, &lsquo;My
son, you must seem to love your people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Father, how shall I <i>seem</i> to love them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My son, you <i>must</i> love them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, to make rooms seem home-like, you must be at home
in them. Human light and warmth are so wanting in
some rooms, it is so evident that they are never used,
that you can never be at ease there. In vain the housemaid
is taught to wheel the sofa and turn chair toward
chair; in vain it is attempted to imitate a negligent arrangement
of the centre-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books that have really been read and laid down, chairs
that have really been moved here and there in the animation
of social contact, have a sort of human vitality in them;
and a room in which people really live and enjoy is as different
from a shut-up apartment as a live woman from a wax
image.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even rooms furnished without taste often become charming
from this one grace, that they seem to let you into
the home life and home current. You seem to understand
in a moment that you are taken into the family, and are
moving in its inner circles, and not revolving at a distance
in some outer court of the gentiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many people do we call on from year to year and
know no more of their feelings, habits, tastes, family ideas
and ways, than if they lived in Kamtschatka! And why?
Because the room which they call a front parlor is made
expressly so that you never shall know. They sit in a
back room,&mdash;work, talk, read, perhaps. After the servant
has let you in and opened a crack of the shutters, and while
you sit waiting for them to change their dress and come in,
you speculate as to what they may be doing. From some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
distant region, the laugh of a child, the song of a canary-bird
reaches you, and then a door claps hastily to. Do
they love plants? Do they write letters, sew, embroider,
crochet? Do they ever romp and frolic? What books do
they read? Do they sketch or paint? Of all these possibilities
the mute and muffled room says nothing. A sofa
and six chairs, two ottomans fresh from the upholsterer&rsquo;s,
a Brussels carpet, a centre-table with four gilt Books of
Beauty on it, a mantel-clock from Paris, and two bronze
vases,&mdash;all those tell you only in frigid tones, &lsquo;This is the
best room,&rsquo;&mdash;only that, and nothing more,&mdash;and soon <i>she</i>
trips in in her best clothes, and apologizes for keeping you
waiting, asks how your mother is, and you remark that it
is a pleasant day, and thus the acquaintance progresses from
year to year. One hour in the back room, where the plants
and canary-bird and children are, might have made you fast
friends for life; but, little as it is, you care no more for
them than for the gilt clock on the mantel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, girls,&rdquo; said I, pulling a paper out of my
pocket, &ldquo;you must know that your father is getting to be
famous by means of these &lsquo;House and Home Papers.&rsquo;
Here is a letter I have just received:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Most Excellent Mr. Crowfield</span>,&mdash;Your thoughts
have lighted into our family circle and echoed from our
fireside. We all feel the force of them, and are delighted
with the felicity of your treatment of the topic you have
chosen. You have taken hold of a subject that lies deep
in our hearts, in a genial, temperate, and convincing spirit.
All must acknowledge the power of your sentiments upon
their imaginations; if they could only trust to them in
actual life! There is the rub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Omitting further upon these points, there is a special
feature of your articles upon which we wish to address you.
You seem as yet (we do not know, of course, what you may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
hereafter do) to speak only of homes whose conduct depends
upon the help of servants. Now your principles apply, as
some of us well conceive, to nearly all classes of society;
yet most people, to take an impressive hint, must have their
portraits drawn out more exactly. We therefore hope that
you will give a reasonable share of your attention to us who
do not employ servants, so that you may ease us of some of
our burdens, which, in spite of common sense, we dare not
throw off. For instance, we have company,&mdash;a friend from
afar (perhaps wealthy), or a minister, or some other man of
note. What do we do? Sit down and receive our visitor
with all good will and the freedom of a home? No; we
(the lady of the house) flutter about to clear up things, apologizing
about this, that, and the other condition of unpreparedness,
and, having settled the visitor in the parlor, set
about marshaling the elements of a grand dinner or supper,
such as no person but a gourmand wants to sit down to,
when at home and comfortable; and in getting up this
meal, clearing away and washing the dishes, we use up a
good half of the time which our guest spends with us. We
have spread ourselves, and shown him what we could do;
but what a paltry, heart-sickening achievement! Now, good
Mr. Crowfield, thou friend of the robbed and despairing, wilt
thou not descend into our purgatorial circle, and tell the
world what thou hast seen there of doleful remembrance?
Tell us how we, who must do and desire to do our own
work, can show forth in our homes a homely yet genial hospitality,
and entertain our guests without making a fuss
and hurlyburly, and seeming to be anxious for their sake
about many things, and spending too much time getting
meals, as if eating were the chief social pleasure. Won&rsquo;t
you do this, Mr. Crowfield?</p>
<p class='sig1'>&ldquo;Yours beseechingly,</p>
<p class='sig2'>&ldquo;R. H. A.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good letter,&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it is,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you answer it, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the very next &lsquo;Atlantic,&rsquo; you may be sure I shall.
The class that do their own work are the strongest, the
most numerous, and, taking one thing with another, quite
as well cultivated a class as any other. They are the
anomaly of our country,&mdash;the distinctive feature of the
new society that we are building up here; and, if we are to
accomplish our national destiny, that class must increase
rather than diminish. I shall certainly do my best to answer
the very sensible and pregnant questions of that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Marianne shivered and drew up a shawl, and Jenny
gaped; my wife folded up the garment in which she had
set the last stitch, and the clock struck twelve.</p>
<p>Bob gave a low whistle. &ldquo;Who knew it was so late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have talked the fire fairly out,&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>

<h3>VI <br /><br />THE LADY WHO DOES HER OWN WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Chris,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it time to be
writing the next &lsquo;House and Home Paper&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was lying back in my study-chair, with my heels luxuriously
propped on an ottoman, reading for the two-hundredth
time Hawthorne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mosses from an Old Manse,&rdquo; or
his &ldquo;Twice-Told Tales,&rdquo; I forget which,&mdash;I only know
that these books constitute my cloud-land, where I love to
sail away in dreamy quietude, forgetting the war, the price
of coal and flour, the rates of exchange, and the rise and
fall of gold. What do all these things matter, as seen from
those enchanted gardens in Padua where the weird Rappaccini
tends his enchanted plants, and his gorgeous daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
fills us with the light and magic of her presence, and saddens
us with the shadowy allegoric mystery of her preternatural
destiny? But my wife represents the positive
forces of time, place, and number in our family, and, having
also a chronological head, she knows the day of the
month, and therefore gently reminded me that by inevitable
dates the time drew near for preparing my&mdash;which is it,
now, May or June number?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, you are right,&rdquo; I said, as by an exertion
I came head-uppermost, and laid down the fascinating
volume. &ldquo;Let me see, what was I to write about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you remember you were to answer that letter
from the lady who does her own work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; said I, seizing the pen with alacrity; &ldquo;you
have hit the exact phrase:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <i>lady</i> who <i>does her own work</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>America is the only country where such a title is possible,&mdash;the
only country where there is a class of women
who may be described as <i>ladies</i> who do their own work.
By a lady we mean a woman of education, cultivation, and
refinement, of liberal tastes and ideas, who, without any
very material additions or changes, would be recognized as
a lady in any circle of the Old World or the New.</p>
<p>What I have said is, that the existence of such a class is
a fact peculiar to American society, a clear, plain result of
the new principles involved in the doctrine of universal
equality.</p>
<p>When the colonists first came to this country, of however
mixed ingredients their ranks might have been composed,
and however imbued with the spirit of feudal and aristocratic
ideas, the discipline of the wilderness soon brought
them to a democratic level; the gentleman felled the wood
for his log-cabin side by side with the ploughman, and thews
and sinews rose in the market. &ldquo;A man was deemed honorable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
in proportion as he lifted his hand upon the high
trees of the forest.&rdquo; So in the interior domestic circle.
Mistress and maid, living in a log-cabin together, became
companions, and sometimes the maid, as the more accomplished
and stronger, took precedence of the mistress. It
became natural and unavoidable that children should begin
to work as early as they were capable of it. The result
was a generation of intelligent people brought up to labor
from necessity, but turning on the problem of labor the
acuteness of a disciplined brain. The mistress, outdone in
sinews and muscles by her maid, kept her superiority by
skill and contrivance. If she could not lift a pail of water
she could invent methods which made lifting the pail unnecessary;
if she could not take a hundred steps without
weariness, she could make twenty answer the purpose of a
hundred.</p>
<p>Slavery, it is true, was to some extent introduced into
New England, but it never suited the genius of the people,
never struck deep root, or spread so as to choke the good
seed of self-helpfulness. Many were opposed to it from
conscientious principle,&mdash;many from far-sighted thrift, and
from a love of thoroughness and well-doing which despised
the rude, unskilled work of barbarians. People, having
once felt the thorough neatness and beauty of execution
which came of free, educated, and thoughtful labor, could
not tolerate the clumsiness of slavery. Thus it came to
pass that for many years the rural population of New England,
as a general rule, did their own work, both out doors
and in. If there were a black man or black woman or
bound girl, they were emphatically only the <i>helps</i>, following
humbly the steps of master and mistress, and used by them
as instruments of lightening certain portions of their toil.
The master and mistress with their children were the head
workers.</p>
<p>Great merriment has been excited in the Old Country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
because years ago the first English travelers found that the
class of persons by them denominated servants were in
America denominated help or helpers. But the term was
the very best exponent of the state of society. There were
few servants in the European sense of the word; there was
a society of educated workers, where all were practically
equal, and where, if there was a deficiency in one family
and an excess in another, a <i>helper</i>, not a servant, was hired.
Mrs. Brown, who has six sons and no daughters, enters
into agreement with Mrs. Jones, who has six daughters and
no sons. She borrows a daughter, and pays her good wages
to help in her domestic toil, and sends a son to help the
labors of Mr. Jones. These two young people go into the
families in which they are to be employed in all respects
as equals and companions, and so the work of the community
is equalized. Hence arose, and for many years continued,
a state of society more nearly solving than any other
ever did the problem of combining the highest culture of
the mind with the highest culture of the muscles and the
physical faculties.</p>
<p>Then were to be seen families of daughters, handsome,
strong females, rising each day to their indoor work with
cheerful alertness,&mdash;one to sweep the room, another to
make the fire, while a third prepared the breakfast for the
father and brothers who were going out to manly labor;
and they chatted meanwhile of books, studies, embroidery,
discussed the last new poem, or some historical topic started
by graver reading, or perhaps a rural ball that was to come
off the next week. They spun with the book tied to the
distaff; they wove; they did all manner of fine needlework;
they made lace, painted flowers, and, in short, in the boundless
consciousness of activity, invention, and perfect health,
set themselves to any work they had ever read or thought
of. A bride in those days was married with sheets and
tablecloths of her own weaving, with counterpanes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
toilet-covers wrought in divers embroidery by her own and
her sisters&rsquo; hands. The amount of fancy work done in our
days by girls who have nothing else to do will not equal
what was done by these, who performed besides, among
them, the whole work of the family.</p>
<p>For many years these habits of life characterized the majority
of our rural towns. They still exist among a class
respectable in numbers and position, though perhaps not as
happy in perfect self-satisfaction and a conviction of the
dignity and desirableness of its lot as in former days. Human
nature is above all things&mdash;lazy. Every one confesses
in the abstract that exertion which brings out all the powers
of body and mind is the best thing for us all; but practically
most people do all they can to get rid of it, and as
a general rule nobody does much more than circumstances
drive him to do. Even I would not write this article were
not the publication-day hard on my heels. I should read
Hawthorne and Emerson and Holmes, and dream in my
armchair, and project in the clouds those lovely unwritten
stories that curl and veer and change like mist-wreaths in
the sun. So also, however dignified, however invigorating,
however really desirable, are habits of life involving daily
physical toil, there is a constant evil demon at every one&rsquo;s
elbow, seducing him to evade it, or to bear its weight with
sullen, discontented murmurs.</p>
<p>I will venture to say that there are at least, to speak very
moderately, a hundred houses where these humble lines will
be read and discussed, where there are no servants except
the ladies of the household. I will venture to say, also,
that these households, many of them, are not inferior in the
air of cultivation and refined elegance to many which are
conducted by the ministration of domestics. I will venture
to assert furthermore that these same ladies who live thus
find quite as much time for reading, letter-writing, drawing,
embroidery, and fancy work as the women of families otherwise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
arranged. I am quite certain that they would be found
on an average to be in the enjoyment of better health, and
more of that sense of capability and vitality which gives one
confidence in one&rsquo;s ability to look into life and meet it with
cheerful courage, than three quarters of the women who
keep servants; and that, on the whole, their domestic establishment
is regulated more exactly to their mind, their
food prepared and served more to their taste. And yet,
with all this, I will <i>not</i> venture to assert that they are
satisfied with this way of living, and that they would not
change it forthwith if they could. They have a secret feeling
all the while that they are being abused, that they are
working harder than they ought to, and that women who
live in their houses like boarders, who have only to speak
and it is done, are the truly enviable ones. One after
another of their associates, as opportunity offers and means
increase, deserts the ranks, and commits her domestic affairs
to the hands of hired servants. Self-respect takes the
alarm. Is it altogether genteel to live as we do? To be
sure, we are accustomed to it; we have it all systematized
and arranged; the work of our own hands suits us better
than any we can hire; in fact, when we do hire, we are discontented
and uncomfortable, for who will do for us what
we will do for ourselves? But when we have company!
there&rsquo;s the rub, to get out all our best things and put them
back,&mdash;to cook the meals and wash the dishes ingloriously,&mdash;and
to make all appear as if we didn&rsquo;t do it, and had
servants like other people.</p>
<p>There, after all, is the rub. A want of hardy self-respect,
an unwillingness to face with dignity the actual facts and
necessities of our situation in life,&mdash;this, after all, is the
worst and most dangerous feature of the case. It is the same
sort of pride which makes Smilax think he must hire a
waiter in white gloves, and get up a circuitous dinner party
on English principles, to entertain a friend from England.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Because the friend in England lives in such and such a style,
he must make believe for a day that he lives so, too, when
in fact it is a whirlwind in his domestic establishment equal
to a removal or a fire, and threatens the total extinction of
Mrs. Smilax. Now there are two principles of hospitality
that people are very apt to overlook. One is, that their
guests like to be made at home, and treated with confidence;
and another is, that people are always interested in the details
of a way of life that is new to them. The Englishman
comes to America as weary of his old, easy, family-coach
life as you can be of yours: he wants to see something new
under the sun,&mdash;something American; and forthwith we
all bestir ourselves to give him something as near as we can
fancy exactly like what he is already tired of. So city
people come to the country, not to sit in the best parlor and
to see the nearest imitation of city life, but to lie on the
haymow, to swing in the barn, to form intimacy with the
pigs, chickens, and ducks, and to eat baked potatoes, exactly
on the critical moment when they are done, from the oven
of the cooking-stove,&mdash;and we remark, <i>en passant</i>, that
nobody has ever truly eaten a baked potato unless he has
seized it at that precise and fortunate moment.</p>
<p>I fancy you now, my friends, whom I have in my eye.
You are three happy women together. You are all so
well that you know not how it feels to be sick. You are
used to early rising, and would not lie in bed if you could.
Long years of practice have made you familiar with the shortest,
neatest, most expeditious method of doing every household
office, so that really, for the greater part of the time in
your house, there seems to a looker-on to be nothing to do.
You rise in the morning and dispatch your husband, father,
and brothers to the farm or wood-lot; you go sociably about
chatting with each other, while you skim the milk, make
the butter, turn the cheeses. The forenoon is long; it&rsquo;s
ten to one that all the so-called morning work is over, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
you have leisure for an hour&rsquo;s sewing or reading before it is
time to start the dinner preparations. By two o&rsquo;clock your
housework is done, and you have the long afternoon for
books, needlework, or drawing,&mdash;for perhaps there is among
you one with a gift at her pencil. Perhaps one of you reads
aloud while the others sew, and you manage in that way
to keep up with a great deal of reading. I see on your
bookshelves Prescott, Macaulay, Irving, besides the lighter
fry of poems and novels, and, if I mistake not, the friendly
covers of the &ldquo;Atlantic.&rdquo; When you have company, you
invite Mrs. Smith or Brown or Jones to tea: you have no
trouble&mdash;they come early, with their knitting or sewing;
your particular crony sits with you by your polished stove
while you watch the baking of those light biscuits and tea
rusks for which you are so famous, and Mrs. Somebodyelse
chats with your sister, who is spreading the table with your
best china in the best room. When tea is over, there is
plenty of volunteering to help you wash your pretty India
teacups, and get them back into the cupboard. There is no
special fatigue or exertion in all this, though you have taken
down the best things and put them back, because you have
done all without anxiety or effort, among those who would
do precisely the same if you were their visitors.</p>
<p>But now comes down pretty Mrs. Simmons and her pretty
daughter to spend a week with you, and forthwith you are
troubled. Your youngest, Fanny, visited them in New
York last fall, and tells you of their cook and chambermaid,
and the servant in white gloves that waits on the table.
You say in your soul, &ldquo;What shall we do? they never can
be contented to live as we do; how shall we manage?&rdquo;
And now you long for servants.</p>
<p>This is the very time that you should know that Mrs.
Simmons is tired to death of her fine establishment, and
weighed down with the task of keeping the peace among
her servants. She is a quiet soul, dearly loving her ease
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
and hating strife; and yet last week she had five quarrels to
settle between her invaluable cook and the other members
of her staff, because invaluable cook, on the strength of
knowing how to get up state dinners and to manage all
sorts of mysteries which her mistress knows nothing about,
asserts the usual right of spoiled favorites to insult all her
neighbors with impunity, and rule with a rod of iron over
the whole house. Anything that is not in the least like
her own home and ways of living will be a blessed relief
and change to Mrs. Simmons. Your clean, quiet house,
your delicate cookery, your cheerful morning tasks, if you
will let her follow you about, and sit and talk with you
while you are at your work, will all seem a pleasant contrast
to her own life. Of course, if it came to the case of
offering to change lots in life, she would not do it; but very
likely she <i>thinks</i> she would, and sighs over and pities herself,
and thinks sentimentally how fortunate you are, how
snugly and securely you live, and wishes she were as untrammeled
and independent as you. And she is more than
half right; for, with her helpless habits, her utter ignorance
of the simplest facts concerning the reciprocal relations of
milk, eggs, butter, saleratus, soda, and yeast, she is completely
the victim and slave of the person she pretends to rule.</p>
<p>Only imagine some of the frequent scenes and rehearsals
in her family. After many trials, she at last engages a
seamstress who promises to prove a perfect treasure,&mdash;neat,
dapper, nimble, skillful, and spirited. The very soul
of Mrs. Simmons rejoices in heaven. Illusive bliss! The
newcomer proves to be no favorite with Madam Cook, and
the domestic fates evolve the catastrophe, as follows. First,
low murmur of distant thunder in the kitchen; then a day
or two of sulky silence, in which the atmosphere seems
heavy with an approaching storm. At last comes the climax.
The parlor door flies open during breakfast. Enter seamstress
in tears, followed by Mrs. Cook, with a face swollen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and red with wrath, who tersely introduces the subject-matter
of the drama in a voice trembling with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be plased, ma&rsquo;am, to suit yerself with
another cook? Me week will be up next Tuesday, and I
want to be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bridget, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter enough, ma&rsquo;am! I niver could live with them
Cork girls in a house, nor I won&rsquo;t; them as likes the Cork
girls is welcome for all me; but it&rsquo;s not for the likes of me
to live with them, and she been in the kitchen a-upsettin&rsquo;
of me gravies with her flatirons and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here bursts in the seamstress with a whirlwind of denial,
and the altercation wages fast and furious, and poor, little,
delicate Mrs. Simmons stands like a kitten in a thunderstorm
in the midst of a regular Irish row.</p>
<p>Cook, of course, is sure of her victory. She knows that
a great dinner is to come off Wednesday, and that her
mistress has not the smallest idea how to manage it, and
that therefore, whatever happens, she must be conciliated.</p>
<p>Swelling with secret indignation at the tyrant, poor Mrs.
Simmons dismisses her seamstress with longing looks. She
suited her mistress exactly, but she didn&rsquo;t suit cook!</p>
<p>Now, if Mrs. Simmons had been brought up in early life
with the experience that you have, she would be mistress in
her own house. She would quietly say to Madam Cook,
&ldquo;If my family arrangements do not suit you, you can leave.
I can see to the dinner myself.&rdquo; And she could do it.
Her well-trained muscles would not break down under a
little extra work; her skill, adroitness, and perfect familiarity
with everything that is to be done would enable her at once
to make cooks of any bright girls of good capacity who
might still be in her establishment; and, above all, she
would feel herself mistress in her own house. This is what
would come of an experience in doing her own work as you
do. She who can at once put her own trained hand to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
machine in any spot where a hand is needed never comes to
be the slave of a coarse, vulgar Irishwoman.</p>
<p>So, also, in forming a judgment of what is to be expected
of servants in a given time, and what ought to be expected
of a given amount of provisions, poor Mrs. Simmons is absolutely
at sea. If even for one six months in her life she
had been a practical cook, and had really had the charge of
the larder, she would not now be haunted, as she constantly
is, by an indefinite apprehension of an immense wastefulness,
perhaps of the disappearance of provisions through secret
channels of relationship and favoritism. She certainly
could not be made to believe in the absolute necessity of so
many pounds of sugar, quarts of milk, and dozens of eggs,
not to mention spices and wine, as are daily required for the
accomplishment of Madam Cook&rsquo;s purposes. But though
now she does suspect and apprehend, she cannot speak with
certainty. She cannot say, &ldquo;<i>I</i> have made these things. I
know exactly what they require. I have done this and
that myself, and know it can be done, and done well, in a
certain time.&rdquo; It is said that women who have been accustomed
to doing their own work become hard mistresses. They
are certainly more sure of the ground they stand on,&mdash;they
are less open to imposition,&mdash;they can speak and act in
their own houses more as those &ldquo;having authority,&rdquo; and
therefore are less afraid to exact what is justly their due,
and less willing to endure impertinence and unfaithfulness.
Their general error lies in expecting that any servant ever
will do as well for them as they will do for themselves, and
that an untrained, undisciplined human being ever <i>can</i> do
housework, or any other work, with the neatness and perfection
that a person of trained intelligence can. It has
been remarked in our armies that the men of cultivation,
though bred in delicate and refined spheres, can bear up
under the hardships of camp-life better and longer than
rough laborers. The reason is, that an educated mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
knows how to use and save its body, to work it and spare
it, as an uneducated mind cannot; and so the college-bred
youth brings himself safely through fatigues which kill the
unreflective laborer. Cultivated, intelligent women, who
are brought up to do the work of their own families, are
labor-saving institutions. They make the head save the
wear of the muscles. By forethought, contrivance, system,
and arrangement, they lessen the amount to be done, and
do it with less expense of time and strength than others.
The old New England motto, <i>Get your work done up in the
forenoon</i>, applied to an amount of work which would keep
a common Irish servant toiling from daylight to sunset.</p>
<p>A lady living in one of our obscure New England towns,
where there were no servants to be hired, at last by sending
to a distant city succeeded in procuring a raw Irish
maid of all work, a creature of immense bone and muscle,
but of heavy, unawakened brain. In one fortnight she
established such a reign of Chaos and old Night in the
kitchen and through the house that her mistress, a delicate
woman, incumbered with the care of young children, began
seriously to think that she made more work each day than
she performed, and dismissed her. What was now to be
done? Fortunately, the daughter of a neighboring farmer
was going to be married in six months, and wanted a little
ready money for her trousseau. The lady was informed
that Miss So-and-so would come to her, not as a servant,
but as hired &ldquo;help.&rdquo; She was fain to accept any help with
gladness. Forthwith came into the family circle a tall, well-dressed
young person, grave, unobtrusive, self-respecting, yet
not in the least presuming, who sat at the family table and
observed all its decorums with the modest self-possession of
a lady. The newcomer took a survey of the labors of a
family of ten members, including four or five young children,
and, looking, seemed at once to throw them into system,
matured her plans, arranged her hours of washing, ironing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
baking, cleaning, rose early, moved deftly, and in a
single day the slatternly and littered kitchen assumed that
neat, orderly appearance that so often strikes one in New
England farmhouses. The work seemed to be all gone.
Everything was nicely washed, brightened, put in place,
and stayed in place: the floors, when cleaned, remained
clean; the work was always done, and not doing; and
every afternoon the young lady sat neatly dressed in her
own apartment, either writing letters to her betrothed, or
sewing on her bridal outfit. Such is the result of employing
those who have been brought up to do their own work.
That tall, fine-looking girl, for aught we know, may yet be
mistress of a fine house on Fifth Avenue; and, if she is,
she will, we fear, prove rather an exacting mistress to Irish
Biddy and Bridget; but she will never be threatened by
her cook and chambermaid, after the first one or two have
tried the experiment.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Having written thus far on my article I laid it aside
till evening, when, as usual, I was saluted by the inquiry,
&ldquo;Has papa been writing anything to-day?&rdquo; and then followed
loud petitions to hear it; and so I read as far,
reader, as you have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;what are you meaning to
make out there? Do you really think it would be best for
us all to try to go back to that old style of living you describe?
After all, you have shown only the dark side of
an establishment with servants, and the bright side of the
other way of living. Mamma does not have such trouble
with her servants; matters have always gone smoothly in
our family; and, if we are not such wonderful girls as those
you describe, yet we may make pretty good housekeepers
on the modern system, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know all the troubles your mamma has had
in your day,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;I have often, in the course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
of my family history, seen the day when I have heartily
wished for the strength and ability to manage my household
matters as my grandmother of notable memory managed
hers. But I fear that those remarkable women of the olden
times are like the ancient painted glass,&mdash;the art of making
them is lost; my mother was less than her mother, and I
am less than my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Marianne and I come out entirely at the little end
of the horn,&rdquo; said Jenny, laughing; &ldquo;yet I wash the breakfast
cups and dust the parlors, and have always fancied myself
a notable housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as I told you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Human nature is
always the same. Nobody ever is or does more than circumstances
force him to be and do. Those remarkable
women of old were made by circumstances. There were,
comparatively speaking, no servants to be had, and so children
were trained to habits of industry and mechanical
adroitness from the cradle, and every household process was
reduced to the very minimum of labor. Every step required
in a process was counted, every movement calculated; and
she who took ten steps, when one would do, lost her reputation
for &lsquo;faculty.&rsquo; Certainly such an early drill was of
use in developing the health and the bodily powers, as well
as in giving precision to the practical mental faculties. All
household economies were arranged with equal niceness in
those thoughtful minds. A trained housekeeper knew just
how many sticks of hickory of a certain size were required
to heat her oven, and how many of each different kind of
wood. She knew by a sort of intuition just what kind of
food would yield the most palatable nutriment with the least
outlay of accessories in cooking. She knew to a minute the
time when each article must go into and be withdrawn from
her oven; and, if she could only lie in her chamber and
direct, she could guide an intelligent child through the processes
with mathematical certainty. It is impossible, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
that anything but early training and long experience
can produce these results, and it is earnestly to be wished
that the grandmothers of New England had only written
down their experiences for our children; they would have
been a mine of maxims and traditions, better than any other
traditions of the elders which we know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I know,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;and that is, I
wish I had been brought up so, and knew all that I should,
and had all the strength and adroitness that those women
had. I should not dread to begin housekeeping, as I now
do. I should feel myself independent. I should feel that
I knew how to direct my servants, and what it was reasonable
and proper to expect of them; and then, as you say, I
shouldn&rsquo;t be dependent on all their whims and caprices of
temper. I dread those household storms, of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently pondering these anxieties of the young expectant
housekeeper, I resumed my pen, and concluded my paper
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>In this country, our democratic institutions have removed
the superincumbent pressure which in the Old World confines
the servants to a regular orbit. They come here feeling
that this is somehow a land of liberty, and with very
dim and confused notions of what liberty is. They are for
the most part the raw, untrained Irish peasantry, and the
wonder is, that, with all the unreasoning heats and prejudices
of the Celtic blood, all the necessary ignorance and
rawness, there should be the measure of comfort and success
there is in our domestic arrangements. But, so long as
things are so, there will be constant changes and interruptions
in every domestic establishment, and constantly recurring
interregnums when the mistress must put her own
hand to the work, whether the hand be a trained or an
untrained one. As matters now are, the young housekeeper
takes life at the hardest. She has very little strength,&mdash;no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
experience to teach her how to save her strength. She
knows nothing experimentally of the simplest processes
necessary to keep her family comfortably fed and clothed;
and she has a way of looking at all these things which
makes them particularly hard and distasteful to her. She
does not escape being obliged to do housework at intervals,
but she does it in a weak, blundering, confused way, that
makes it twice as hard and disagreeable as it need be.</p>
<p>Now what I have to say is, that, if every young woman
learned to do housework and cultivated her practical faculties
in early life, she would, in the first place, be much
more likely to keep her servants, and, in the second place,
if she lost them temporarily, would avoid all that wear and
tear of the nervous system which comes from constant ill-success
in those departments on which family health and
temper mainly depend. This is one of the peculiarities of
our American life which require a peculiar training. Why
not face it sensibly?</p>
<p>The second thing I have to say is, that our land is now
full of motorpathic institutions to which women are sent at
great expense to have hired operators stretch and exercise
their inactive muscles. They lie for hours to have their
feet twigged, their arms flexed, and all the different muscles
of the body worked for them, because they are so flaccid
and torpid that the powers of life do not go on. Would it
not be quite as cheerful and less expensive a process if
young girls from early life developed the muscles in sweeping,
dusting, ironing, rubbing furniture, and all the multiplied
domestic processes which our grandmothers knew of?
A woman who did all these, and diversified the intervals
with spinning on the great and little wheel, never came to
need the gymnastics of Dio Lewis or of the Swedish motorpathist,
which really are a necessity now. Does it not seem
poor economy to pay servants for letting our muscles grow
feeble, and then to pay operators to exercise them for us?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
I will venture to say that our grandmothers in a week went
over every movement that any gymnast has invented, and
went over them to some productive purpose, too.</p>
<p>Lastly, my paper will not have been in vain if those
ladies who have learned and practice the invaluable accomplishment
of doing their own work will know their own
happiness and dignity, and properly value their great acquisition,
even though it may have been forced upon them
by circumstances.</p>

<h3>VII <br /><br />WHAT CAN BE GOT IN AMERICA</h3>
</div>
<p>While I was preparing my article for the &ldquo;Atlantic,&rdquo;
our friend Bob Stephens burst in upon us, in some considerable
heat, with a newspaper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls, your time is come now! You women have
been preaching heroism and sacrifice to us,&mdash;&lsquo;so splendid
to go forth and suffer and die for our country,&rsquo;&mdash;and now
comes the test of feminine patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; said Jenny, running
eagerly to look over his shoulder at the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more foreign goods,&rdquo; said he, waving it aloft,&mdash;&ldquo;no
more gold shipped to Europe for silks, laces, jewels,
kid gloves, and what not. Here it is,&mdash;great movement,
headed by senators&rsquo; and generals&rsquo; wives, Mrs. General Butler,
Mrs. John P. Hale, Mrs. Henry Wilson, and so on, a
long string of them, to buy no more imported articles during
the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how it <i>can</i> be done,&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you suppose that &lsquo;nothing to wear&rsquo;
is made in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Mr. Crowfield,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, a
nice girl, who was just then one of our family circle, &ldquo;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
is not, positively, much that is really fit to use or wear
made in America,&mdash;is there now? Just think: how is
Marianne to furnish her house here without French papers
and English carpets?&mdash;those American papers are so very
ordinary, and, as to American carpets, everybody knows
their colors don&rsquo;t hold; and then, as to dress, a lady must
have gloves, you know,&mdash;and everybody knows no such
things are made in America as gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I have heard of certain fair
ladies wishing that they were men, that they might show
with what alacrity they would sacrifice everything on the
altar of their country: life and limb would be nothing;
they would glory in wounds and bruises, they would enjoy
losing a right arm, they wouldn&rsquo;t mind limping about on a
lame leg the rest of their lives, if they were John or Peter,
if only they might serve their dear country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s female patriotism! Girls are
always ready to jump off from precipices, or throw themselves
into abysses, but as to wearing an unfashionable hat
or thread gloves, that they can&rsquo;t do,&mdash;not even for their
dear country. No matter whether there&rsquo;s any money left
to pay for the war or not, the dear souls must have twenty
yards of silk in a dress,&mdash;it&rsquo;s the fashion, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t he too bad?&rdquo; said Marianne. &ldquo;As if
we&rsquo;d ever been asked to make these sacrifices and refused!
I think I have seen women ready to give up dress and
fashion and everything else for a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the history of all wars has
shown women ready to sacrifice what is most intimately
feminine in times of peril to their country. The women of
Carthage not only gave up their jewels in the siege of their
city, but, in the last extremity, cut off their hair for bowstrings.
The women of Hungary and Poland, in their
country&rsquo;s need, sold their jewels and plate and wore ornaments
of iron and lead. In the time of our own Revolution,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
our women dressed in plain homespun and drank herb-tea,&mdash;and
certainly nothing is more feminine than a cup of
tea. And in this very struggle, the women of the Southern
States have cut up their carpets for blankets, have borne
the most humiliating retrenchments and privations of all
kinds without a murmur. So let us exonerate the female
sex of want of patriotism, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;and if our Northern women
have not retrenched and made sacrifices, it has been because
it has not been impressed on them that there is any
particular call for it. Everything has seemed to be so prosperous
and plentiful in the Northern States, money has been
so abundant and easy to come by, that it has really been
difficult to realize that a dreadful and destructive war was
raging. Only occasionally, after a great battle, when the
lists of the killed and wounded have been sent through the
country, have we felt that we were making a sacrifice. The
women who have spent such sums for laces and jewels and
silks have not had it set clearly before them why they
should not do so. The money has been placed freely in
their hands, and the temptation before their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I am quite sure that there are hundreds
who have been buying foreign goods who would not
do it if they could see any connection between their not
doing it and the salvation of the country; but when I go to
buy a pair of gloves, I naturally want the best pair I can
find, the pair that will last the longest and look the best,
and these always happen to be French gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;I never could clearly
see why people should confine their patronage and encouragement
to works of their own country. I&rsquo;m sure the poor
manufacturers of England have shown the very noblest
spirit with relation to our cause, and so have the silk weavers
and artisans of France,&mdash;at least, so I have heard; why
should we not give them a fair share of encouragement, particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
when they make things that we are not in circumstances
to make, have not the means to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are certainly sensible questions,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and
ought to meet a fair answer, and I should say that, were our
country in a fair ordinary state of prosperity, there would be
no reason why our wealth should not flow out for the encouragement
of well-directed industry in any part of the
world; from this point of view we might look on the whole
world as our country, and cheerfully assist in developing its
wealth and resources. But our country is now in the situation
of a private family whose means are absorbed by an
expensive sickness, involving the life of its head: just now
it is all we can do to keep the family together; all our means
are swallowed up by our own domestic wants; we have nothing
to give for the encouragement of other families, we
must exist ourselves; we must get through this crisis and
hold our own, and, that we may do it, all the family expenses
must be kept within ourselves as far as possible. If we
drain off all the gold of the country to send to Europe to
encourage her worthy artisans, we produce high prices and
distress among equally worthy ones at home, and we lessen
the amount of our resources for maintaining the great struggle
for national existence. The same amount of money
which we pay for foreign luxuries, if passed into the hands
of our own manufacturers and producers, becomes available
for the increasing expenses of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I understood that a great part
of our governmental income was derived from the duties on
foreign goods, and so I inferred that the more foreign goods
were imported the better it would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that for every hundred thousand
dollars we send out of the country we pay the government
ten thousand; that is about what our gain as a nation
would be: we send our gold abroad in a great stream, and
give our government a little driblet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;what can be got
in America? Hardly anything, I believe, except common
calicoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, my dear lady,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is
where you and multitudes of others are greatly mistaken.
Your partiality for foreign things has kept you ignorant of
what you have at home. Now I am not blaming the love
of foreign things: it is not peculiar to us Americans; all
nations have it. It is a part of the poetry of our nature to
love what comes from afar, and reminds us of lands distant
and different from our own. The English belles seek after
French laces; the French beauty enumerates English laces
among her rarities; and the French dandy piques himself
upon an English tailor. We Americans are great travelers,
and few people travel, I fancy, with more real enjoyment
than we; our domestic establishments, as compared with
those of the Old World, are less cumbrous and stately, and
so our money is commonly in hand as pocket-money, to be
spent freely and gayly in our tours abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have such bright and pleasant times in every country
that we conceive a kindliness for its belongings. To send
to Paris for our dresses and our shoes and our gloves may
not be a mere bit of foppery, but a reminder of the bright,
pleasant hours we have spent in that city of boulevards and
fountains. Hence it comes, in a way not very blamable,
that many people have been so engrossed with what can be
got from abroad that they have neglected to inquire what
can be found at home: they have supposed, of course, that
to get a decent watch they must send to Geneva or to London;
that to get thoroughly good carpets they must have
the English manufacture; that a really tasteful wall-paper
could be found only in Paris; and that flannels and broadcloths
could come only from France, Great Britain, or Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone. &ldquo;I certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
have always thought so; I never heard of American
watches, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t have read an article
that you should have read on the Waltham watches,
written by our friend George W. Curtis, in the &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo;
for January of last year. I must refer you to that to learn
that we make in America watches superior to those of Switzerland
or England, bringing into the service machinery and
modes of workmanship unequaled for delicacy and precision;
as I said before, you must get the article and read it, and, if
some sunny day you could make a trip to Waltham and
see the establishment, it would greatly assist your comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as to men&rsquo;s clothing,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I know to
my entire satisfaction that many of the most popular cloths
for men&rsquo;s wear are actually American fabrics baptized with
French and English names to make them sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shows,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the use of a general community
movement to employ American goods. It will change
the fashion. The demand will create the supply. When
the leaders of fashion are inquiring for American instead of
French and English fabrics, they will be surprised to find
what nice American articles there are. The work of our
own hands will no more be forced to skulk into the market
under French and English names, and we shall see, what is
really true, that an American gentleman need not look beyond
his own country for a wardrobe befitting him. I am
positive that we need not seek broadcloth or other woolen
goods from foreign lands,&mdash;that <i>better</i> hats are made in
America than in Europe, and better boots and shoes; and I
should be glad to send an American gentleman to the World&rsquo;s
Fair dressed from top to toe in American manufactures,
with an American watch in his pocket, and see if he would
suffer in comparison with the gentlemen of any other country.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as to house-furnishing,&rdquo; began my wife, &ldquo;American
carpets are getting to be every way equal to the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, what is more, the Brussels carpets
of England are woven on looms invented by an American,
and bought of him. Our countryman, Bigelow, went to
England to study carpet-weaving in the English looms,
supposing that all arts were generously open for the instruction
of learners. He was denied the opportunity of studying
the machinery and watching the processes by a shortsighted
jealousy. He immediately sat down with a yard
of carpeting, and, patiently unraveling it thread by thread,
combined and calculated till he invented the machinery on
which the best carpets of the Old and the New World are
woven. No pains which such ingenuity and energy can
render effective are spared to make our fabrics equal those
of the British market, and we need only to be disabused of
the old prejudice, and to keep up with the movement of our
own country, and find out our own resources. The fact is,
every year improves our fabrics. Our mechanics, our manufacturers,
are working with an energy, a zeal, and a skill that
carry things forward faster than anybody dreams of; and
nobody can predicate the character of American articles in
any department now by their character even five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to wall-papers,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;there
you must confess the French are and must be unequaled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not confess any such thing,&rdquo; said I hardily. &ldquo;I
grant you that, in that department of paper-hangings which
exhibits floral decoration, the French designs and execution
are, and must be for some time to come, far ahead of all
the world: their drawing of flowers, vines, and foliage has
the accuracy of botanical studies and the grace of finished
works of art, and we cannot as yet pretend in America to do
anything equal to it. But for satin finish, and for a variety
of exquisite tints of plain colors, American papers equal any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
in the world: our gilt papers even surpass in the heaviness
and polish of the gilding those of foreign countries; and we
have also gorgeous velvets. All I have to say is, let people
who are furnishing houses inquire for articles of American
manufacture, and they will be surprised at what they will
see. We need go no farther than our Cambridge glassworks
to see that the most dainty devices of cut-glass,
crystal, ground and engraved glass of every color and
pattern, may be had of American workmanship, every way
equal to the best European make, and for half the price.
And American painting on china is so well executed, both in
Boston and New York, that deficiencies in the finest French
or English sets can be made up in a style not distinguishable
from the original, as one may easily see by calling on our
worthy next neighbor, Briggs, who holds the opposite corner
to our &lsquo;Atlantic Monthly.&rsquo; No porcelain, it is true,
is yet made in America, these decorative arts being exercised
on articles imported from Europe. Our tables must,
therefore, perforce, be largely indebted to foreign lands for
years to come. Exclusive of this item, however, I believe
it would require very little self-denial to paper, carpet, and
furnish a house entirely from the manufactures of America.
I cannot help saying one word here in favor of the cabinet-makers
of Boston. There is so much severity of taste, such
a style and manner about the best-made Boston furniture,
as raises it really quite into the region of the fine arts.
Our artisans have studied foreign models with judicious
eyes, and so transferred to our country the spirit of what is
best worth imitating that one has no need to import furniture
from Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;there is one point
you cannot make out,&mdash;gloves; certainly the French have
the monopoly of that article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to ruin my cause by asserting too
much,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been with nicely dressed women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
so many years not to speak with proper respect of
Alexander&rsquo;s gloves; and I confess honestly that to forego
them must be a fair, square sacrifice to patriotism. But
then, on the other hand, it is nevertheless true that gloves
have long been made in America and surreptitiously brought
into market as French. I have lately heard that very nice
kid gloves are made at Watertown and in Philadelphia. I
have only heard of them and not seen. A loud demand
might bring forth an unexpected supply from these and
other sources. If the women of America were bent on
having gloves made in their own country, how long would
it be before apparatus and factories would spring into being?
Look at the hoop-skirt factories; women wanted
hoop-skirts,&mdash;would have them or die,&mdash;and forthwith
factories arose, and hoop-skirts became as the dust of the
earth for abundance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;and, to say the truth,
the American hoop-skirts are the only ones fit to wear.
When we were living on the Champs Élysées, I remember
we searched high and low for something like them, and
finally had to send home to America for some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that shows what I said. Let there
be only a hearty call for an article and it will come. These
spirits of the vasty deep are not so very far off, after all, as
we may imagine, and women&rsquo;s unions and leagues will lead
to inquiries and demands which will as infallibly bring supplies
as a vacuum will create a draught of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, at least, there are no ribbons made in America,&rdquo;
said Miss Featherstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my lady, there is a ribbon factory now in operation
in Boston, and ribbons of every color are made in
New York; there is also in the vicinity of Boston a factory
which makes Roman scarfs. This shows that the faculty
of weaving ribbons is not wanting to us Americans, and
a zealous patronage would increase the supply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as for a thousand and one little feminine needs,
I believe our manufacturers can supply them. The Portsmouth
Steam Company makes white spool-cotton equal to
any in England, and colored spool-cotton, of every shade
and variety, such as is not made either in England or
France. Pins are well made in America; so are hooks and
eyes, and a variety of buttons. Straw bonnets of American
manufacture are also extensively in market, and quite as
pretty ones as the double-priced ones which are imported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to silks and satins, I am not going to pretend that
they are to be found here. It is true, there are silk manufactories,
like that of the Cheneys in Connecticut, where
very pretty foulard dress-silks are made, together with sewing-silk
enough to supply a large demand. Enough has
been done to show that silks might be made in America;
but at present, as compared with Europe, we claim neither
silks nor thread laces among our manufactures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what then? These are not necessaries of life.
Ladies can be very tastefully dressed in other fabrics besides
silks. There are many pretty American dress-goods
which the leaders of fashion might make fashionable, and
certainly no leader of fashion could wish to dress for a nobler
object than to aid her country in deadly peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a life-pledge, not a total abstinence, that is
asked,&mdash;only a temporary expedient to meet a stringent
crisis. We only ask a preference for American goods where
they can be found. Surely, women whose exertions in
Sanitary Fairs have created an era in the history of the
world will not shrink from so small a sacrifice for so obvious
a good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something in which every individual woman
can help. Every woman who goes into a shop and asks
for American goods renders an appreciable aid to our cause.
She expresses her opinion and her patriotism, and her voice
forms a part of that demand which shall arouse and develop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
the resources of her country. We shall learn to know our
own country. We shall learn to respect our own powers,
and every branch of useful labor will spring and flourish
under our well-directed efforts. We shall come out of
our great contest, not bedraggled, ragged, and poverty-stricken,
but developed, instructed, and rich. Then will
we gladly join with other nations in the free interchange of
manufactures, and gratify our eye and taste with what is
foreign, while we can in turn send abroad our own productions
in equal ratio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;I should
think it was the Fourth of July; but I yield the point.
I am convinced; and henceforth you will see me among
the most stringent of the leaguers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>And, fair lady reader, let me hope you will say the same.
You can do something for your country,&mdash;it lies right in
your hand. Go to the shops, determined on supplying your
family and yourself with American goods. Insist on having
them; raise the question of origin over every article
shown to you. In the Revolutionary times, some of the
leading matrons of New England gave parties where the
ladies were dressed in homespun and drank sage tea. Fashion
makes all things beautiful, and you, my charming and
accomplished friend, can create beauty by creating fashion.
What makes the beauty of half the Cashmere shawls?
Not anything in the shawls themselves, for they often look
coarse and dingy and barbarous. It is the association with
style and fashion. Fair lady, give style and fashion to the
products of your own country,&mdash;resolve that the money
in your hand shall go to your brave brothers, to your co-Americans,
now straining every nerve to uphold the nation
and cause it to stand high in the earth. What are you
without your country? As Americans you can hope for
no rank but the rank of your native land, no badge of nobility
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
but her beautiful stars. It rests with this conflict to
decide whether those stars shall be badges of nobility to you
and your <ins title="Was childen">children</ins> in all lands. Women of America, your
country expects every woman to do her duty!</p>

<h3>VIII <br /><br />ECONOMY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Jenny, as she twirled a little hat on
her hand, which she had been making over, with nobody
knows what of bows and pompons, and other matters for
which the women have curious names,&mdash;&ldquo;the fact is,
American women and girls must learn to economize; it
isn&rsquo;t merely restricting one&rsquo;s self to American goods, it is
general economy, that is required. Now here&rsquo;s this hat,&mdash;costs
me only three dollars, all told; and Sophie Page
bought an English one this morning at Madam Meyer&rsquo;s for
which she gave fifteen. And I really don&rsquo;t think hers has
more of an air than mine. I made this over, you see, with
things I had in the house, bought nothing but the ribbon,
and paid for altering and pressing, and there you see what
a stylish hat I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely! admirable!&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone. &ldquo;Upon
my word, Jenny, you ought to marry a poor parson; you
would be quite thrown away upon a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I want to admire intelligently.
That isn&rsquo;t the hat you were wearing yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, papa! This is just done. The one I wore yesterday
was my waterfall-hat, with the green feather; this,
you see, is an oriole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An oriole. Papa, how can you expect to learn about
these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that plain little black one, with the stiff crop of
scarlet feathers sticking straight up?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my jockey, papa, with a plume <i>en militaire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the waterfall and the jockey cost anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were very, very cheap, papa, all things considered.
Miss Featherstone will remember that the waterfall
was a great bargain, and I had the feather from last year;
and as to the jockey, that was made out of my last year&rsquo;s
white one, dyed over. You know, papa, I always take
care of my things, and they last from year to year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you, Mr. Crowfield,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone,
&ldquo;I never saw such little economists as your daughters;
it is perfectly wonderful what they contrive to dress
on. How they manage to do it I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t see. I
never could, I&rsquo;m convinced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought but just one new hat.
I only wish you could sit in church where we do, and see
those Miss Fielders. Marianne and I have counted six
new hats apiece of those girls&rsquo;,&mdash;<i>new</i>, you know, just out
of the milliner&rsquo;s shop; and last Sunday they came out in
such lovely puffed tulle bonnets! Weren&rsquo;t they lovely,
Marianne? And next Sunday, I don&rsquo;t doubt, there&rsquo;ll be
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone,&mdash;&ldquo;their father, they
say, has made a million dollars lately on government contracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I think such extravagance,
at such a time as this, is shameful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m quite sure the
Misses Fielder think they are practicing rigorous economy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa! Now there you are with your paradoxes! How
can you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to bet a pair of gloves, now,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;that Miss Fielder thinks herself half ready for
translation, because she has bought only six new hats and
a tulle bonnet so far in the season. If it were not for her
dear bleeding country, she would have had thirty-six, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the Misses Sibthorpe. If we were admitted to the secret
councils of the Fielders, doubtless we should perceive what
temptations they daily resist; how perfectly rubbishy and
dreadful they suffer themselves to be, because they feel it
important now, in this crisis, to practice economy; how
they abuse the Sibthorpes, who have a new hat every time
they drive out, and never think of wearing one more than
two or three times; how virtuous and self-denying they
feel when they think of the puffed tulle, for which they
only gave eighteen dollars, when Madame Caradori showed
them those lovely ones, like the Misses Sibthorpe&rsquo;s, for
forty-five; and how they go home descanting on virgin
simplicity, and resolving that they will not allow themselves
to be swept into the vortex of extravagance, whatever
other people may do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone, &ldquo;I believe
your papa is right? I was calling on the oldest Miss
Fielder the other day, and she told me that she positively
felt ashamed to go looking as she did, but that she really did
feel the necessity of economy. &lsquo;Perhaps we might afford to
spend more than some others,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s so much
better to give the money to the Sanitary Commission!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am going to put forth another
paradox, and say that very likely there are some people
looking on my girls, and commenting on them for extravagance
in having three hats, even though made over, and
contrived from last year&rsquo;s stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t know anything about it, then,&rdquo; said Jenny
decisively; &ldquo;for, certainly, nobody can be decent and invest
less in millinery than Marianne and I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a young lady,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;a well-dressed
girl got her a new bonnet in the spring, and another
in the fall; that was the extent of her purchases in this
line. A second-best bonnet, left of last year, did duty to
relieve and preserve the best one. My father was accounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
well-to-do, but I had no more, and wanted no more. I also
bought myself, every spring, two pair of gloves, a dark and
a light pair, and wore them through the summer, and another
two through the winter; one or two pair of white kids,
carefully cleaned, carried me through all my parties. Hats
had not been heard of, and the great necessity which requires
two or three new ones every spring and fall had
not arisen. Yet I was reckoned a well-appearing girl, who
dressed liberally. Now, a young lady who has a waterfall-hat,
an oriole-hat, and a jockey must still be troubled with
anxious cares for her spring and fall and summer and winter
bonnets,&mdash;all the variety will not take the place of them.
Gloves are bought by the dozen; and as to dresses, there
seems to be no limit to the quantity of material and trimming
that may be expended upon them. When I was a
young lady, seventy-five dollars a year was considered by
careful parents a liberal allowance for a daughter&rsquo;s wardrobe.
I had a hundred, and was reckoned rich; and I
sometimes used a part to make up the deficiencies in the
allowance of Sarah Evans, my particular friend, whose
father gave her only fifty. We all thought that a very
scant allowance; yet she generally made a very pretty and
genteel appearance, with the help of occasional presents
from friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could a girl dress for fifty dollars?&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could get a white muslin and a white cambric,
which, with different sortings of ribbons, served her for all
dress occasions. A silk, in those days, took only ten yards
in the making, and one dark silk was considered a reasonable
allowance to a lady&rsquo;s wardrobe. Once made, it stood
for something,&mdash;always worn carefully, it lasted for years.
One or two calico morning-dresses, and a merino for winter
wear, completed the list. Then, as to collars, capes, cuffs,
etc., we all did our own embroidering, and very pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
things we wore, too. Girls looked as prettily then as they
do now, when four or five hundred dollars a year is insufficient
to clothe them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, you know our allowance isn&rsquo;t anything
like that,&mdash;it is quite a slender one, though not so small
as yours was,&rdquo; said Marianne. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the customs
of society make a difference? Do you think, as things
are, we could go back and dress for the sum you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;without a greater sacrifice
of feeling than I wish to impose on you. Still, though
I don&rsquo;t see how to help it, I cannot but think that the requirements
of fashion are becoming needlessly extravagant,
particularly in regard to the dress of women. It seems to
me, it is making the support of families so burdensome that
young men are discouraged from marriage. A young man,
in a moderately good business, might cheerfully undertake
the world with a wife who could make herself pretty and
attractive for seventy-five dollars a year, when he might sigh
in vain for one who positively could not get through, and
be decent, on four hundred. Women, too, are getting to
be so attached to the trappings and accessories of life that
they cannot think of marriage without an amount of fortune
which few young men possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking in very low numbers about the dress
of women,&rdquo; said Miss Featherstone. &ldquo;I do assure you that
it is the easiest thing in the world for a girl to make away
with a thousand dollars a year, and not have so much to
show for it, either, as Marianne and Jenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Only establish certain formulas
of expectation, and it is the easiest thing in the world.
For instance, in your mother&rsquo;s day girls talked of a pair of
gloves,&mdash;now they talk of a pack; then it was a bonnet
summer and winter,&mdash;now it is a bonnet spring, summer,
autumn, and winter, and hats like monthly roses,&mdash;a new
blossom every few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;every device of the toilet
is immediately taken up and varied and improved on, so as
to impose an almost monthly necessity for novelty. The
jackets of May are outshone by the jackets of June; the
buttons of June are antiquated in July; the trimmings of
July are <i>passées</i> by September; side-combs, back-combs,
puffs, rats, and all sorts of such matters, are in a distracted
race of improvement; every article of feminine toilet is on
the move towards perfection. It seems to me that an infinity
of money must be spent in these trifles by those who
make the least pretension to keep in the fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;after all, it&rsquo;s just the way
things always have been since the world began. You know
the Bible says, &lsquo;Can a maid forget her ornaments?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
clear she can&rsquo;t. You see, it&rsquo;s a law of nature; and you
remember all that long chapter in the Bible that we had read
in church last Sunday about the curls and veils and tinkling
ornaments and crimping-pins, and all that, of those wicked
daughters of Zion in old times. Women always have been
too much given to dress, and they always will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;how can any woman,
I, for example, know what is too much or too little? In
mamma&rsquo;s day, it seems, a girl could keep her place in society,
by hard economy, and spend only fifty dollars a year
on her dress. Mamma found a hundred dollars ample. I
have more than that, and find myself quite straitened to
keep myself looking well. I don&rsquo;t want to live for dress,
to give all my time and thoughts to it; I don&rsquo;t wish to be
extravagant: and yet I wish to be lady-like&mdash;it annoys
and makes me unhappy not to be fresh and neat and nice,
shabbiness and seediness are my aversion. I don&rsquo;t see
where the fault is. Can one individual resist the whole
current of society? It certainly is not strictly necessary for
us girls to have half the things we do. We might, I suppose,
live without many of them, and, as mamma says, look just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
as well, because girls did so before these things were invented.
Now I confess I flatter myself, generally, that I
am a pattern of good management and economy, because
I get so much less than other girls I associate with. I
wish you could see Miss Thorne&rsquo;s fall dresses that she
showed me last year when she was visiting here. She had
six gowns, and no one of them could have cost less than
seventy or eighty dollars, and some of them must have been
even more expensive, and yet I don&rsquo;t doubt that this fall
she will feel that she must have just as many more. She
runs through and wears out these expensive things, with
all their velvet and thread lace, just as I wear my commonest
ones; and at the end of the season they are really gone,&mdash;spotted,
stained, frayed, the lace all pulled to pieces,&mdash;nothing
left to save or make over. I feel as if Jenny and
I were patterns of economy when I see such things. I
really don&rsquo;t know what economy is. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the same difficulty in my housekeeping,&rdquo; said
my wife. &ldquo;I think I am an economist. I mean to be one.
All our expenses are on a modest scale, and yet I can see
much that really is not strictly necessary; but if I compare
myself with some of my neighbors, I feel as if I were
hardly respectable. There is no subject on which all the
world are censuring one another so much as this. Hardly
any one but thinks her neighbors extravagant in some one
or more particulars, and takes for granted that she herself is
an economist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture to say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that there isn&rsquo;t a woman
of my acquaintance that does not think she is an economist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa is turned against us women, like all the rest of
them,&rdquo; said Jenny. &ldquo;I wonder if it isn&rsquo;t just so with
the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the fashion to talk as if
all the extravagance of the country was perpetrated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
women. For my part, I think young men are just as extravagant.
Look at the sums they spend for cigars and
meerschaums,&mdash;an expense which hasn&rsquo;t even the pretense
of usefulness in any way; it&rsquo;s a purely selfish, nonsensical
indulgence. When a girl spends money in making herself
look pretty, she contributes something to the agreeableness
of society; but a man&rsquo;s cigars and pipes are neither ornamental
nor useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look at their dress,&rdquo; said Jenny: &ldquo;they are to
the full as fussy and particular about it as girls; they have
as many fine, invisible points of fashion, and their fashions
change quite as often; and they have just as many knick-knacks,
with their studs and their sleeve buttons and waistcoat
buttons, their scarfs and scarf pins, their watch chains
and seals and seal rings, and nobody knows what. Then
they often waste and throw away more than women, because
they are not good judges of material, nor saving in what
they buy, and have no knowledge of how things should be
cared for, altered, or mended. If their cap is a little too
tight, they cut the lining with a penknife, or slit holes in
a new shirt-collar because it does not exactly fit to their
mind. For my part, I think men are naturally twice as
wasteful as women. A pretty thing, to be sure, to have
all the waste of the country laid to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, child,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;women are by nature,
as compared with men, the care-taking and saving part of
creation,&mdash;the authors and conservators of economy. As
a general rule, man earns and woman saves and applies.
The wastefulness of woman is commonly the fault of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see into that,&rdquo; said Bob Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way. Economy is the science of proportion.
Whether a particular purchase is extravagant depends
mainly on the income it is taken from. Suppose a woman
has a hundred and fifty a year for her dress, and gives fifty
dollars for a bonnet, she gives a third of her income,&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
is a horrible extravagance; while for the woman whose
income is ten thousand it may be no extravagance at all.
The poor clergyman&rsquo;s wife, when she gives five dollars for
a bonnet, may be giving as much in proportion to her
income as the woman who gives fifty. Now the difficulty
with the greater part of women is, that the men, who make
the money and hold it, give them no kind of standard by
which to measure their expenses. Most women and girls
are in this matter entirely at sea, without chart or compass.
They don&rsquo;t know in the least what they have to spend.
Husbands and fathers often pride themselves about not saying
a word on business matters to their wives and daughters.
They don&rsquo;t wish them to understand them, or to inquire
into them, or to make remarks or suggestions concerning
them. &lsquo;I want you to have everything that is suitable
and proper,&rsquo; says Jones to his wife, &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t be extravagant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, my dear,&rsquo; says Mrs. Jones, &lsquo;what is suitable and
proper depends very much on our means; if you could
allow me any specific sum for dress and housekeeping, I
could tell better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, Susan! I can&rsquo;t do that,&mdash;it&rsquo;s too much
trouble. Get what you need, and avoid foolish extravagances;
that&rsquo;s all I ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by Mrs. Jones&rsquo;s bills are sent in, in an evil
hour, when Jones has heavy notes to meet, and then comes
a domestic storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall just be ruined, madam, if that&rsquo;s the way you
are going on. I can&rsquo;t afford to dress you and the girls in
the style you have set up: look at this milliner&rsquo;s bill!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; says Mrs. Jones, &lsquo;we haven&rsquo;t got any
more than the Stebbinses, nor so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the Stebbinses are worth five
times as much as ever I was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Jones did not know it: how should she,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
when her husband makes it a rule never to speak of his
business to her, and she has not the remotest idea of his
income?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus multitudes of good, conscientious women and girls
are extravagant from pure ignorance. The male provider
allows bills to be run up in his name, and they have no
earthly means of judging whether they are spending too
much or too little, except the semi-annual hurricane which
attends the coming in of these bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first essential in the practice of economy is a knowledge
of one&rsquo;s income, and the man who refuses to accord
to his wife and children this information has never any
right to accuse them of extravagance, because he himself
deprives them of that standard of comparison which is an
indispensable requisite in economy. As early as possible in
the education of children, they should pass from that state
of irresponsible waiting to be provided for by parents, and
be trusted with the spending of some fixed allowance, that
they may learn prices and values, and have some notion of
what money is actually worth and what it will bring. The
simple fact of the possession of a fixed and definite income
often suddenly transforms a giddy, extravagant girl into
a care-taking, prudent little woman. Her allowance is her
own; she begins to plan upon it,&mdash;to add, subtract, multiply,
divide, and do numberless sums in her little head.
She no longer buys everything she fancies; she deliberates,
weighs, compares. And now there is room for self-denial
and generosity to come in. She can do without this article;
she can furbish up some older possession to do duty a little
longer, and give this money to some friend poorer than she;
and ten to one the girl whose bills last year were four or
five hundred finds herself bringing through this year creditably
on a hundred and fifty. To be sure, she goes without
numerous things which she used to have. From the
standpoint of a fixed income she sees that these are impossible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and no more wants them than the green cheese of the
moon. She learns to make her own taste and skill take the
place of expensive purchases. She refits her hats and bonnets,
retrims her dresses, and in a thousand busy, earnest,
happy little ways sets herself to make the most of her small
income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the woman who has her definite allowance for housekeeping
finds at once a hundred questions set at rest. Before
it was not clear to her why she should not &lsquo;go and do
likewise&rsquo; in relation to every purchase made by her next
neighbor. Now, there is a clear logic of proportion. Certain
things are evidently not to be thought of, though next
neighbors do have them; and we must resign ourselves to
find some other way of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I think there is a peculiar
temptation in a life organized as ours is in America. There
are here no settled classes, with similar ratios of income.
Mixed together in the same society, going to the same parties,
and blended in daily neighborly intercourse, are families
of the most opposite extremes in point of fortune. In
England there is a very well understood expression, that
people should not dress or live above their station; in America
none will admit that they have any particular station,
or that they can live above it. The principle of democratic
equality unites in society people of the most diverse positions
and means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, for instance, is a family like Dr. Selden&rsquo;s: an
old and highly respected one, with an income of only two
or three thousand; yet they are people universally sought
for in society, and mingle in all the intercourse of life with
merchant millionaires whose incomes are from ten to thirty
thousand. Their sons and daughters go to the same schools,
the same parties, and are thus constantly meeting upon terms
of social equality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it seems to me that our danger does not lie in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
great and evident expenses of our richer friends. We do
not expect to have pineries, graperies, equipages, horses,
diamonds,&mdash;we say openly and of course that we do not.
Still, our expenses are constantly increased by the proximity
of these things, unless we understand ourselves better than
most people do. We don&rsquo;t, of course, expect to get a fifteen-hundred-dollar
Cashmere, like Mrs. So-and-so, but we begin
to look at hundred-dollar shawls and nibble about the hook.
We don&rsquo;t expect sets of diamonds, but a diamond ring, a
pair of solitaire diamond ear-rings, begin to be speculated
about among the young people as among possibilities. We
don&rsquo;t expect to carpet our house with Axminster and hang
our windows with damask, but at least we must have Brussels
and brocatelle,&mdash;it <i>would not do</i> not to. And so we
go on getting hundreds of things that we don&rsquo;t need, that
have no real value except that they soothe our self-love;
and for these inferior articles we pay a higher proportion of
our income than our rich neighbor does for his better ones.
Nothing is uglier than low-priced Cashmere shawls; and yet
a young man just entering business will spend an eighth of
a year&rsquo;s income to put one on his wife, and when he has put
it there it only serves as a constant source of disquiet, for,
now that the door is opened and Cashmere shawls are possible,
she is consumed with envy at the superior ones constantly
sported around her. So, also, with point-lace, velvet
dresses, and hundreds of things of that sort, which belong
to a certain rate of income, and are absurd below it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, mamma, I heard Aunt Easygo say that velvet,
point-lace, and Cashmere were the cheapest finery that
could be bought, because they lasted a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Easygo speaks from an income of ten thousand a
year: they may be cheap for her rate of living; but for us, for
example, by no magic of numbers can it be made to appear
that it is cheaper to have the greatest bargain in the world
in Cashmere, lace, and diamonds than not to have them at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
all. I never had a diamond, never wore a piece of point-lace,
never had a velvet dress, and have been perfectly
happy, and just as much respected as if I had. Who ever
thought of objecting to me for not having them? Nobody,
that I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, mamma,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I have always said to you girls is, that
you were not to expect to live like richer people, not to begin
to try, not to think or inquire about certain rates of expenditure,
or take the first step in certain directions. We
have moved on all our life after a very antiquated and old-fashioned
mode. We have had our little, old-fashioned
house, our little old-fashioned ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except the parlor carpet, and what came of it, my
dear,&rdquo; said I mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except the parlor carpet,&rdquo; said my wife, with a
conscious twinkle, &ldquo;and the things that came of it; there
was a concession there, but one can&rsquo;t be wise always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> talked mamma into that,&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one thing is certain,&rdquo; said my wife,&mdash;&ldquo;that,
though I have had an antiquated, plain house, and plain
furniture, and plain dress, and not the beginning of a thing
such as many of my neighbors have possessed, I have spent
more money than many of them for real comforts. While
I had young children, I kept more and better servants than
many women who wore Cashmere and diamonds. I thought
it better to pay extra wages to a really good, trusty woman
who lived with me from year to year, and relieved me of
some of my heaviest family cares, than to have ever so
much lace locked away in my drawers. We always were
able to go into the country to spend our summers, and to
keep a good family horse and carriage for daily driving,&mdash;by
which means we afforded, as a family, very poor patronage
to the medical profession. Then we built our house,
and, while we left out a great many expensive commonplaces
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
that other people think they must have, we put in a
profusion of bathing accommodations such as very few people
think of having. There never was a time when we did
not feel able to afford to do what was necessary to preserve
or to restore health; and for this I always drew on the surplus
fund laid up by my very unfashionable housekeeping
and dressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother has had,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what is the great want
in America, perfect independence of mind to go her own
way without regard to the way others go. I think there is,
for some reason, more false shame among Americans about
economy than among Europeans. &lsquo;I cannot afford it&rsquo; is
more seldom heard among us. A young man beginning
life, whose income may be from five to eight hundred a
year, thinks it elegant and gallant to affect a careless air
about money, especially among ladies,&mdash;to hand it out
freely, and put back his change without counting it,&mdash;to
wear a watch chain and studs and shirt-fronts like those
of some young millionaire. None but the most expensive
tailors, shoemakers, and hatters will do for him; and then
he grumbles at the dearness of living, and declares that he
cannot get along on his salary. The same is true of young
girls, and of married men and women, too,&mdash;the whole of
them are ashamed of economy. The cares that wear out
life and health in many households are of a nature that
cannot be cast on God, or met by any promise from the
Bible: it is not care for &lsquo;food convenient,&rsquo; or for comfortable
raiment, but care to keep up false appearances, and
to stretch a narrow income over the space that can be covered
only by a wider one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor widow in her narrow lodgings, with her
monthly rent staring her hourly in the face, and her bread
and meat and candles and meal all to be paid for on delivery
or not obtained at all, may find comfort in the good old
Book, reading of that other widow whose wasting measure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
of oil and last failing handful of meal were of such account
before her Father in heaven that a prophet was sent to
recruit them; and when customers do not pay, or wages
are cut down, she can enter into her chamber, and, when she
hath shut her door, present to her Father in heaven His
sure promise that with the fowls of the air she shall be fed
and with the lilies of the field she shall be clothed: but
what promises are there for her who is racking her brains
on the ways and means to provide as sumptuous an entertainment
of oysters and champagne at her next party as
her richer neighbor, or to compass that great bargain which
shall give her a point-lace set almost as handsome as that
of Mrs. Cr&oelig;sus, who has ten times her income?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, with a twinge of that exacting
sensitiveness by which the child is characterized, &ldquo;I
think I am an economist, thanks to you and mamma, so far
as knowing just what my income is, and keeping within it;
but that does not satisfy me, and it seems that isn&rsquo;t all
of economy; the question that haunts me is, Might I not
make my little all do more and better than I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have hit the broader and deeper
signification of economy, which is, in fact, the science of
<i>comparative values</i>. In its highest sense, economy is a
just judgment of the comparative value of things,&mdash;money
only the means of enabling one to express that value.
This is the reason why the whole matter is so full of difficulty,&mdash;why
every one criticises his neighbor in this
regard. Human beings are so various, the necessities of
each are so different, they are made comfortable or uncomfortable
by such opposite means, that the spending of other
people&rsquo;s incomes must of necessity often look unwise from
our standpoint. For this reason multitudes of people who
cannot be accused of exceeding their incomes often seem to
others to be spending them foolishly and extravagantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there no standard of value?&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain things upon which there is a pretty
general agreement, verbally, at least, among mankind. For
instance, it is generally agreed that <i>health</i> is an indispensable
good,&mdash;that money is well spent that secures it, and
worse than ill spent that ruins it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this standard in mind, how much money is wasted
even by people who do not exceed their income! Here
a man builds a house, and pays, in the first place, ten
thousand more than he need, for a location in a fashionable
part of the city, though the air will be closer and the
chances of health less; he spends three or four thousand
more on a stone front, on marble mantels imported from
Italy, on plate-glass windows, plated hinges, and a thousand
nice points of finish, and has perhaps but one bath-room
for a whole household, and that so connected with his own
apartment that nobody but himself and his wife can use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another man buys a lot in an open, airy situation,
which fashion has not made expensive, and builds without
a stone front, marble mantels, or plate-glass windows, but
has a perfect system of ventilation through his house, and
bathing-rooms in every story, so that the children and guests
may all, without inconvenience, enjoy the luxury of abundant
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first spends for fashion and show, the second for
health and comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a man that will buy his wife a diamond bracelet
and a lace shawl, and take her yearly to Washington to show
off her beauty in ball dresses, who yet will not let her pay
wages which will command any but the poorest and most
inefficient domestic service. The woman is worn out, her
life made a desert by exhaustion consequent on a futile
attempt to keep up a showy establishment with only half
the hands needed for the purpose. Another family will
give brilliant parties, have a gay season every year at the
first hotels at Newport, and not be able to afford the wife a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
fire in her chamber in midwinter, or the servants enough
food to keep them from constantly deserting. The damp,
mouldy, dingy cellar-kitchen, the cold, windy, desolate attic,
devoid of any comfort, where the domestics are doomed to
pass their whole time, are witnesses to what such families
consider economy. Economy in the view of some is undisguised
slipshod slovenliness in the home circle for the sake
of fine clothes to be shown abroad; it is undisguised hard
selfishness to servants and dependants, counting their every
approach to comfort a needless waste,&mdash;grudging the
Roman Catholic cook her cup of tea at dinner on Friday,
when she must not eat meat,&mdash;and murmuring that a
cracked, second-hand looking-glass must be got for the servants&rsquo;
room: what business have they to want to know how
they look?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some families will employ the cheapest physician, without
regard to his ability to kill or cure; some will treat
diseases in their incipiency with quack medicines, bought
cheap, hoping thereby to fend off the doctor&rsquo;s bill. Some
women seem to be pursued by an evil demon of economy,
which, like an <i>ignis fatuus</i> in a bog, delights constantly to
tumble them over into the mire of expense. They are dismayed
at the quantity of sugar in the recipe for preserves,
leave out a quarter, and the whole ferments and is spoiled.
They cannot by any means be induced at any one time to
buy enough silk to make a dress, and the dress finally, after
many convulsions and alterations, must be thrown by altogether
as too scanty. They get poor needles, poor thread,
poor sugar, poor raisins, poor tea, poor coal. One wonders,
in looking at their blackened, smouldering grates in a freezing
day, what the fire is there at all for,&mdash;it certainly
warms nobody. The only thing they seem likely to be
lavish in is funeral expenses, which come in the wake of
leaky shoes and imperfect clothing. These funeral expenses
at last swallow all, since nobody can dispute an undertaker&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
bill. One pities these joyless beings. Economy,
instead of a rational act of the judgment, is a morbid monomania,
eating the pleasure out of life, and haunting them
to the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people&rsquo;s ideas of economy seem to run simply in
the line of eating. Their flour is of an extra brand, their
meat the first cut; the delicacies of every season, in their
dearest stages, come home to their table with an apologetic
smile,&mdash;&lsquo;It was scandalously dear, my love, but I thought
we must just treat ourselves.&rsquo; And yet these people cannot
afford to buy books, and pictures they regard as an unthought-of
extravagance. Trudging home with fifty dollars&rsquo;
worth of delicacies on his arm, Smith meets Jones, who is
exulting with a bag of crackers under one arm and a choice
little bit of an oil painting under the other, which he thinks
a bargain at fifty dollars. &lsquo;<i>I</i> can&rsquo;t afford to buy pictures,&rsquo;
Smith says to his spouse, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t know how Jones
and his wife manage.&rsquo; Jones and his wife will live on
bread and milk for a month, and she will turn her best
gown the third time, but they will have their picture, and
they are happy. Jones&rsquo;s picture remains, and Smith&rsquo;s fifty
dollars&rsquo; worth of oysters and canned fruit to-morrow will be
gone forever. Of all modes of spending money, the swallowing
of expensive dainties brings the least return. There
is one step lower than this,&mdash;the consuming of luxuries
that are injurious to the health. If all the money spent on
tobacco and liquors could be spent in books and pictures, I
predict that nobody&rsquo;s health would be a whit less sound, and
houses would be vastly more attractive. There is enough
money spent in smoking, drinking, and over-eating to give
every family in the community a good library, to hang
everybody&rsquo;s parlor walls with lovely pictures, to set up in
every house a conservatory which should bloom all winter
with choice flowers, to furnish every dwelling with ample
bathing and warming accommodations, even down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
dwellings of the poor; and in the millennium I believe this
is the way things are to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these times of peril and suffering, if the inquiry
arises, How shall there be retrenchment? I answer, First
and foremost, retrench things needless, doubtful, and positively
hurtful, as rum, tobacco, and all the meerschaums of
divers colors that do accompany the same. Second, retrench
all eating not necessary to health and comfort. A French
family would live in luxury on the leavings that are constantly
coming from the tables of those who call themselves
in middling circumstances. There are superstitions
of the table that ought to be broken through. Why must
you always have cake in your closet? why need you feel
undone to entertain a guest with no cake on your tea-table?
Do without it a year, and ask yourselves if you or your
children, or any one else, have suffered materially in consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it imperative that you should have two or three
courses at every meal? Try the experiment of having but
one, and that a very good one, and see if any great amount
of suffering ensues. Why must social intercourse so largely
consist in eating? In Paris there is a very pretty custom.
Each family has one evening in the week when it stays at
home and receives friends. Tea, with a little bread and
butter and cake, served in the most informal way, is the
only refreshment. The rooms are full, busy, bright,&mdash;everything
as easy and joyous as if a monstrous supper,
with piles of jelly and mountains of cake, were waiting to
give the company a nightmare at the close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said a lady, pointing to a gentleman and his wife in
a social circle of this kind, &lsquo;I ought to know them well,&mdash;I
have seen them every week for twenty years.&rsquo; It is
certainly pleasant and confirmative of social enjoyment for
friends to eat together; but a little enjoyed in this way
answers the purpose as well as a great deal, and better, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;in the matter of dress,
now,&mdash;how much ought one to spend just to look as others
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I saw the other night, girls, in
the parlor of one of our hotels. Two middle-aged Quaker
ladies came gliding in, with calm, cheerful faces, and lustrous
dove-colored silks. By their conversation I found
that they belonged to that class of women among the
Friends who devote themselves to traveling on missions of
benevolence. They had just completed a tour of all the
hospitals for wounded soldiers in the country, where they
had been carrying comforts, arranging, advising, and soothing
by their cheerful, gentle presence. They were now
engaged on another mission, to the lost and erring of their
own sex; night after night, guarded by a policeman, they
had ventured after midnight into the dance-houses where
girls are being led to ruin, and with gentle words of tender,
motherly counsel sought to win them from their fatal ways,&mdash;telling
them where they might go the next day to find
friends who would open to them an asylum and aid them
to seek a better life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I looked upon these women, dressed with such modest
purity, I began secretly to think that the Apostle was
not wrong when he spoke of women adorning themselves
with the <i>ornament</i> of a meek and quiet spirit; for the
habitual gentleness of their expression, the calmness and
purity of the lines in their faces, the delicacy and simplicity
of their apparel, seemed of themselves a rare and peculiar
beauty. I could not help thinking that fashionable bonnets,
flowing lace sleeves, and dresses elaborately trimmed
could not have improved even their outward appearance.
Doubtless their simple wardrobe needed but a small trunk
in traveling from place to place, and hindered but little
their prayers and ministrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it is true, all women are not called to such a life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
as this; but might not all women take a leaf at least from
their book? I submit the inquiry humbly. It seems to
me that there are many who go monthly to the sacrament,
and receive it with sincere devotion, and who give thanks
each time sincerely that they are thus made &lsquo;members incorporate
in the mystical body of Christ,&rsquo; who have never
thought of this membership as meaning that they should
share Christ&rsquo;s sacrifices for lost souls, or abridge themselves
of one ornament or encounter one inconvenience for
the sake of those wandering sheep for whom he died. Certainly
there is a higher economy which we need to learn,&mdash;that
which makes all things subservient to the spiritual and
immortal, and that not merely to the good of our own souls
and those of our family, but of all who are knit with us in
the great bonds of human brotherhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been from time to time, among well-meaning
Christian people, retrenchment societies on high moral
grounds, which have failed for want of knowledge how to
manage the complicated question of necessaries and luxuries.
These words have a signification in the case of different
people as varied as the varieties of human habit and
constitution. It is a department impossible to be bound
by external rules, but none the less should every high-minded
Christian soul in this matter have a law unto itself.
It may safely be laid down as a general rule, that no income,
however large or however small, should be unblessed
by the divine touch of self-sacrifice. Something for the
poor, the sorrowing, the hungry, the tempted, and the weak
should be taken from <i>what is our own</i> at the expense of
some personal sacrifice, or we suffer more morally than the
brother from whom we withdraw it. Even the Lord of all,
when dwelling among men, out of that slender private purse
which he accepted for his little family of chosen ones, had
ever something reserved to give to the poor. It is easy to
say, &lsquo;It is but a drop in the bucket. I cannot remove the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
great mass of misery in the world. What little I could
save or give does nothing.&rsquo; It does this, if no more,&mdash;it
prevents one soul, and that soul your own, from drying
and hardening into utter selfishness and insensibility; it
enables you to say, I have done something; taken one atom
from the great heap of sins and miseries and placed it on
the side of good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sisters of Charity and the Friends, each with their
different costume of plainness and self-denial, and other
noble-hearted women of no particular outward order, but
kindred in spirit, have shown to womanhood, on the battlefield
and in the hospital, a more excellent way,&mdash;a beauty
and nobility before which all the common graces and ornaments
of the sex fade, appear like dim candles by the pure,
eternal stars.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IX <br /><br />SERVANTS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the course of my papers various domestic revolutions
have occurred. Our Marianne has gone from us with a
new name to a new life, and a modest little establishment
not many squares off claims about as much of my wife&rsquo;s
and Jenny&rsquo;s busy thoughts as those of the proper mistress.</p>
<p>Marianne, as I always foresaw, is a careful and somewhat
anxious housekeeper. Her tastes are fastidious; she
is made for exactitude: the smallest departures from the
straight line appear to her shocking deviations. She had
always lived in a house where everything had been formed
to quiet and order under the ever-present care and touch of
her mother; nor had she ever participated in those cares
more than to do a little dusting of the parlor ornaments,
or wash the best china, or make sponge-cake or chocolate-caramels.
Certain conditions of life had always appeared
so to be matters of course that she had never conceived of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
a house without them. It never occurred to her that such
bread and biscuit as she saw at the home table would not
always and of course appear at every table,&mdash;that the silver
would not always be as bright, the glass as clear, the
salt as fine and smooth, the plates and dishes as nicely arranged,
as she had always seen them, apparently without
the thought or care of any one; for my wife is one of those
housekeepers whose touch is so fine that no one feels it.
She is never heard scolding or reproving,&mdash;never entertains
her company with her recipes for cookery or the faults
of her servants. She is so unconcerned about receiving her
own personal share of credit for the good appearance of her
establishment that even the children of the house have
not supposed that there is any particular will of hers in the
matter: it all seems the natural consequence of having
very good servants.</p>
<p>One phenomenon they had never seriously reflected on,&mdash;that,
under all the changes of the domestic cabinet which
are so apt to occur in American households, the same coffee,
the same bread and biscuit, the same nicely prepared dishes
and neatly laid table, always gladdened their eyes; and from
this they inferred only that good servants were more abundant
than most people had supposed. They were somewhat
surprised when these marvels were wrought by professedly
green hands, but were given to suppose that these green
hands must have had some remarkable quickness or aptitude
for acquiring. That sparkling jelly, well-flavored ice-creams,
clear soups, and delicate biscuits could be made by
a raw Irish girl, fresh from her native Erin, seemed to
them a proof of the genius of the race; and my wife, who
never felt it important to attain to the reputation of a cook,
quietly let it pass.</p>
<p>For some time, therefore, after the inauguration of the
new household, there was trouble in the camp. Sour bread
had appeared on the table; bitter, acrid coffee had shocked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and astonished the palate; lint had been observed on
tumblers, and the spoons had sometimes dingy streaks
on the brightness of their first bridal polish; beds were
detected made shockingly awry: and Marianne came burning
with indignation to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a little family as we have, and two strong girls,&rdquo;
said she,&mdash;&ldquo;everything ought to be perfect; there is really
nothing to do. Think of a whole batch of bread absolutely
sour! and when I gave that away, then this morning another
exactly like it! and when I talked to cook about it,
she said she had lived in this and that family, and her bread
had always been praised as equal to the baker&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt she is right,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Many families
never have anything but sour bread from one end of the
year to the other, eating it unperceiving, and with good
cheer; and they buy also sour bread of the baker, with like
approbation,&mdash;lightness being in their estimation the only
virtue necessary in the article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you not correct her fault?&rdquo; suggested my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done all I can. I told her we could not have
such bread, that it was dreadful; Bob says it would give
him the dyspepsia in a week; and then she went and made
exactly the same! It seems to me mere willfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose, instead of such general directions,
you should analyze her proceedings and find out just
where she makes her mistake: is the root of the trouble
in the yeast, or in the time she begins it, letting it rise too
long?&mdash;the time, you know, should vary so much with
the temperature of the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I know nothing. I never
noticed; it never was my business to make bread; it always
seemed quite a simple process, mixing yeast and flour and
kneading it; and our bread at home was always good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems, then, my dear, that you have come to your
profession without even having studied it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>My wife smiled and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Marianne, I proposed to you to be our
family bread-maker for one month of the year before you
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma, I remember; but I was like other girls:
I thought there was no need of it. I never liked to do such
things; perhaps I had better have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly had,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the first business of
a housekeeper in America is that of a teacher. She can
have a good table only by having practical knowledge, and
tact in imparting it. If she understands her business practically
and experimentally, her eye detects at once the weak
spot; it requires only a little tact, some patience, some
clearness in giving directions, and all comes right. I venture
to say that your mother would have exactly such bread
as always appears on our table, and have it by the hands
of your cook, because she could detect and explain to her
exactly her error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;what yeast she uses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a kind she makes herself.
I think I heard her say so. I know she makes a
great fuss about it, and rather values herself upon it. She
is evidently accustomed to being praised for her bread, and
feels mortified and angry, and I don&rsquo;t know how to manage
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you carry your watch to a watchmaker,
and undertake to show him how to regulate the
machinery, he laughs and goes on his own way; but if a
brother-machinist makes suggestions, he listens respectfully.
So, when a woman who knows nothing of woman&rsquo;s work
undertakes to instruct one who knows more than she does,
she makes no impression; but a woman who has been trained
experimentally, and shows she understands the matter thoroughly,
is listened to with respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that your Bridget is worth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
teaching. She is honest, well-principled, and tidy. She has
good recommendations from excellent families, whose ideas
of good bread, it appears, differ from ours; and with a little
good-nature, tact, and patience, she will come into your ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the coffee, mamma,&mdash;you would not imagine it to
be from the same bag with your own, so dark and so bitter;
what do you suppose she has done to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;She has let the berries
stay a few moments too long over the fire,&mdash;they are burnt,
instead of being roasted; and there are people who think it
essential to good coffee that it should look black, and have
a strong, bitter flavor. A very little change in the preparing
will alter this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Marianne, if you want my advice, I&rsquo;ll
give it to you gratis: make your own bread for one month.
Simple as the process seems, I think it will take as long as
that to give you a thorough knowledge of all the possibilities
in the case; but after that you will never need to make
any more,&mdash;you will be able to command good bread by the
aid of all sorts of servants; you will, in other words, be a
thoroughly prepared teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;that so simple a thing
required so much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simple,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;and yet requires a delicate
care and watchfulness. There are fifty ways to spoil good
bread; there are a hundred little things to be considered
and allowed for that require accurate observation and experience.
The same process that will raise good bread in cold
weather will make sour bread in the heat of summer; different
qualities of flour require variations in treatment, as
also different sorts and conditions of yeast; and when all is
done, the baking presents another series of possibilities which
require exact attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; said Marianne gayly, &ldquo;that I must begin
to study my profession at the eleventh hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But there is this
advantage on your side: a well-trained mind, accustomed to
reflect, analyze, and generalize, has an advantage over uncultured
minds even of double experience. Poor as your cook
is, she now knows more of her business than you do. After
a very brief period of attention and experiment you will not
only know more than she does, but you will convince her
that you do, which is quite as much to the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same manner,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;you will have to
give lessons to your other girl on the washing of silver and
the making of beds. Good servants do not often come to
us: they must be <i>made</i> by patience and training; and if a
girl has a good disposition and a reasonable degree of handiness,
and the housekeeper understands her profession, she
may make a good servant out of an indifferent one. Some
of my best girls have been those who came to me directly
from the ship, with no preparation but docility and some
natural quickness. The hardest cases to be managed are
not of those who have been taught nothing, but of those
who have been taught wrongly,&mdash;who come to you self-opinionated,
with ways which are distasteful to you, and
contrary to the genius of your housekeeping. Such require
that their mistress shall understand at least so much of the
actual conduct of affairs as to prove to the servant that there
are better ways than those in which she has hitherto been
trained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, mamma,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;that there
has been a sort of reaction against woman&rsquo;s work in our
day? So much has been said of the higher sphere of woman,
and so much has been done to find some better work
for her, that insensibly, I think, almost everybody begins to
feel that it is rather degrading for a woman in good society
to be much tied down to family affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;since in these Woman&rsquo;s
Rights Conventions there is so much indignation expressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
at those who would confine her ideas to the kitchen and
nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is reason in all things,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s
Rights Conventions are a protest against many former absurd,
unreasonable ideas,&mdash;the mere physical and culinary
idea of womanhood as connected only with puddings and
shirt-buttons, the unjust and unequal burdens which the
laws of harsher ages had cast upon the sex. Many of the
women connected with these movements are as superior in
everything properly womanly as they are in exceptional
talent and culture. There is no manner of doubt that the
sphere of woman is properly to be enlarged, and that republican
governments in particular are to be saved from corruption
and failure only by allowing to woman this enlarged
sphere. Every woman has rights as a human being first,
which belong to no sex, and ought to be as freely conceded
to her as if she were a man,&mdash;and, first and foremost, the
great right of doing anything which God and Nature evidently
have fitted her to excel in. If she be made a natural
orator, like Miss Dickinson, or an astronomer, like Mrs.
Somerville, or a singer, like Grisi, let not the technical
rules of womanhood be thrown in the way of her free use
of her powers. Nor can there be any reason shown why a
woman&rsquo;s vote in the state should not be received with as
much respect as in the family. A state is but an association
of families, and laws relate to the rights and immunities
which touch woman&rsquo;s most private and immediate wants
and dearest hopes; and there is no reason why sister, wife,
and mother should be more powerless in the state than
in the home. Nor does it make a woman unwomanly to
express an opinion by dropping a slip of paper into a box,
more than to express that same opinion by conversation.
In fact, there is no doubt that, in all matters relating to the
interests of education, temperance, and religion, the state
would be a material gainer by receiving the votes of women.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, having said all this, I must admit, <i>per contra</i>, not
only a great deal of crude, disagreeable talk in these conventions,
but a too great tendency of the age to make the
education of women anti-domestic. It seems as if the world
never could advance except like ships under a head wind,
tacking and going too far, now in this direction and now
in the opposite. Our common-school system now rejects
sewing from the education of girls, which very properly
used to occupy many hours daily in school a generation ago.
The daughters of laborers and artisans are put through algebra,
geometry, trigonometry, and the higher mathematics,
to the entire neglect of that learning which belongs distinctively
to woman. A girl cannot keep pace with her class
if she gives any time to domestic matters, and accordingly
she is excused from them all during the whole term of her
education. The boy of a family, at an early age, is put to
a trade, or the labors of a farm; the father becomes impatient
of his support, and requires of him to care for himself.
Hence an interrupted education,&mdash;learning coming by
snatches in the winter months, or in the intervals of work.
As the result, the females in our country towns are commonly,
in mental culture, vastly in advance of the males of
the same household; but with this comes a physical delicacy,
the result of an exclusive use of the brain and a neglect
of the muscular system, with great inefficiency in practical
domestic duties. The race of strong, hardy, cheerful
girls, that used to grow up in country places, and made
the bright, neat, New England kitchens of old times,&mdash;the
girls that could wash, iron, brew, bake, harness a horse and
drive him, no less than braid straw, embroider, draw, paint,
and read innumerable books,&mdash;this race of women, pride
of olden time, is daily lessening; and in their stead come
the fragile, easily fatigued, languid girls of a modern age,
drilled in book-learning, ignorant of common things. The
great danger of all this, and of the evils that come from it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
is that society by and by will turn as blindly against female
intellectual culture as it now advocates it, and, having
worked disproportionately one way, will work disproportionately
in the opposite direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that domestic service is
the great problem of life here in America; the happiness
of families, their thrift, well-being, and comfort, are more
affected by this than by any one thing else. Our girls, as
they have been brought up, cannot perform the labor of
their own families, as in those simpler, old-fashioned days
you tell of; and, what is worse, they have no practical skill
with which to instruct servants, and servants come to us,
as a class, raw and untrained; so what is to be done? In
the present state of prices, the board of a domestic costs
double her wages, and the waste she makes is a more serious
matter still. Suppose you give us an article upon this subject
in your &lsquo;House and Home Papers.&rsquo; You could not
have a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>So I sat down, and wrote thus on</p>
<h4>SERVANTS AND SERVICE</h4>
<p>Many of the domestic evils in America originate in the
fact that, while society here is professedly based on new
principles which ought to make social life in every respect
different from the life of the Old World, yet these principles
have never been so thought out and applied as to give
consistency and harmony to our daily relations. America
starts with a political organization based on a declaration
of the primitive freedom and equality of all men. Every
human being, according to this principle, stands on the
same natural level with every other, and has the same chance
to rise, according to the degree of power or capacity given
by the Creator. All our civil institutions are designed to
preserve this equality, as far as possible, from generation to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
generation: there is no entailed property, there are no
hereditary titles, no monopolies, no privileged classes,&mdash;all
are to be as free to rise and fall as the waves of the sea.</p>
<p>The condition of domestic service, however, still retains
about it something of the influences from feudal times, and
from the near presence of slavery in neighboring States.
All English literature, all the literature of the world, describes
domestic service in the old feudal spirit and with the
old feudal language, which regarded the master as belonging
to a privileged class and the servant to an inferior one.
There is not a play, not a poem, not a novel, not a history,
that does not present this view. The master&rsquo;s rights, like
the rights of kings, were supposed to rest in his being born
in a superior rank. The good servant was one who, from
childhood, had learned &ldquo;to order himself lowly and reverently
to all his betters.&rdquo; When New England brought to
these shores the theory of democracy, she brought, in the
persons of the first pilgrims, the habits of thought and of
action formed in aristocratic communities. Winthrop&rsquo;s Journal,
and all the old records of the earlier colonists, show
households where masters and mistresses stood on the &ldquo;right
divine&rdquo; of the privileged classes, howsoever they might
have risen up against authorities themselves.</p>
<p>The first consequence of this state of things was a universal
rejection of domestic service in all classes of American-born
society. For a generation or two, there was, indeed,
a sort of interchange of family strength,&mdash;sons and daughters
engaging in the service of neighboring families, in default
of a sufficient working force of their own, but always
on conditions of strict equality. The assistant was to share
the table, the family sitting-room, and every honor and attention
that might be claimed by son or daughter. When
families increased in refinement and education so as to make
these conditions of close intimacy with more uncultured
neighbors disagreeable, they had to choose between such intimacies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
and the performance of their own domestic toil.
No wages could induce a son or daughter of New England
to take the condition of a servant on terms which they
thought applicable to that of a slave. The slightest hint of
a separate table was resented as an insult; not to enter the
front door, and not to sit in the front parlor on state occasions,
was bitterly commented on as a personal indignity.</p>
<p>The well-taught, self-respecting daughters of farmers, the
class most valuable in domestic service, gradually retired
from it. They preferred any other employment, however
laborious. Beyond all doubt, the labors of a well-regulated
family are more healthy, more cheerful, more interesting,
because less monotonous, than the mechanical toils of a factory;
yet the girls of New England, with one consent, preferred
the factory, and left the whole business of domestic
service to a foreign population; and they did it mainly because
they would not take positions in families as an inferior
laboring class by the side of others of their own age
who assumed as their prerogative to live without labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you have one of my daughters,&rdquo; said an energetic
matron to her neighbor from the city, who was seeking
for a servant in her summer vacation; &ldquo;if you hadn&rsquo;t
daughters of your own, maybe I would; but my girls ain&rsquo;t
going to work so that your girls may live in idleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was vain to offer money. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need your money,
ma&rsquo;am, we can support ourselves in other ways; my girls
can braid straw and bind shoes, but they ain&rsquo;t going to be
slaves to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Irish and German servants who took the place of
Americans in families, there was, to begin with, the tradition
of education in favor of a higher class; but even the
foreign population became more or less infected with the
spirit of democracy. They came to this country with vague
notions of freedom and equality, and in ignorant and uncultivated
people such ideas are often more unreasonable for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
being vague. They did not, indeed, claim a seat at the
table and in the parlor, but they repudiated many of those
habits of respect and courtesy which belonged to their
former condition, and asserted their own will and way in
the round, unvarnished phrase which they supposed to be
their right as republican citizens. Life became a sort of domestic
wrangle and struggle between the employers, who
secretly confessed their weakness, but endeavored openly to
assume the air and bearing of authority, and the employed,
who knew their power and insisted on their privileges.
From this cause domestic service in America has had less of
mutual kindliness than in old countries. Its terms have
been so ill understood and defined that both parties have
assumed the defensive; and a common topic of conversation
in American female society has often been the general servile
war which in one form or another was going on in their
different families,&mdash;a war as interminable as would be a
struggle between aristocracy and common people, undefined
by any bill of rights or constitution, and therefore opening
fields for endless disputes. In England, the class who go to
service <i>are</i> a class, and service is a profession; the distance
between them and their employers is so marked and defined,
and all the customs and requirements of the position are so
perfectly understood, that the master or mistress has no fear
of being compromised by condescension, and no need of the
external voice or air of authority. The higher up in the
social scale one goes, the more courteous seems to become
the intercourse of master and servant; the more perfect and
real the power, the more is it veiled in outward expression,&mdash;commands
are phrased as requests, and gentleness of voice
and manner covers an authority which no one would think
of offending without trembling.</p>
<p>But in America all is undefined. In the first place, there
is no class who mean to make domestic service a profession
to live and die in. It is universally an expedient, a stepping-stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
to something higher; your best servants always
have something else in view as soon as they have laid by a
little money; some form of independence which shall give
them a home of their own is constantly in mind. Families
look forward to the buying of landed homesteads, and the
scattered brothers and sisters work awhile in domestic service
to gain the common fund for the purpose; your seamstress
intends to become a dressmaker, and take in work at
her own house; your cook is pondering a marriage with the
baker, which shall transfer her toils from your cooking-stove
to her own. Young women are eagerly rushing into
every other employment, till female trades and callings are
all overstocked. We are continually harrowed with tales
of the sufferings of distressed needlewomen, of the exactions
and extortions practiced on the frail sex in the many
branches of labor and trade at which they try their hands;
and yet women will encounter all these chances of ruin and
starvation rather than make up their minds to permanent
domestic service. Now what is the matter with domestic
service? One would think, on the face of it, that a calling
which gives a settled home, a comfortable room, rent-free,
with fire and lights, good board and lodging, and steady,
well-paid wages, would certainly offer more attractions than
the making of shirts for tenpence, with all the risks of providing
one&rsquo;s own sustenance and shelter.</p>
<p>I think it is mainly from the want of a definite idea of
the true position of a servant under our democratic institutions
that domestic service is so shunned and avoided in
America, that it is the very last thing which an intelligent
young woman will look to for a living. It is more the
want of personal respect toward those in that position than
the labors incident to it which repels our people from it.
Many would be willing to perform these labors, but they
are not willing to place themselves in a situation where
their self-respect is hourly wounded by <i>the implication of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
a degree of inferiority which does not follow any kind of
labor or service in this country but that of the family</i>.</p>
<p>There exists in the minds of employers an unsuspected
spirit of superiority, which is stimulated into an active form
by the resistance which democracy inspires in the working
class. Many families think of servants only as a necessary
evil, their wages as exactions, and all that is allowed them
as so much taken from the family; and they seek in every
way to get from them as much and to give them as little as
possible. Their rooms are the neglected, ill-furnished, incommodious
ones,&mdash;and the kitchen is the most cheerless
and comfortless place in the house. Other families, more
good-natured and liberal, provide their domestics with more
suitable accommodations, and are more indulgent; but there
is still a latent spirit of something like contempt for the
position. That they treat their servants with so much consideration
seems to them a merit entitling them to the most
prostrate gratitude; and they are constantly disappointed
and shocked at that want of sense of inferiority on the part
of these people which leads them to appropriate pleasant
rooms, good furniture, and good living as mere matters of
common justice.</p>
<p>It seems to be a constant surprise to some employers that
servants should insist on having the same human wants as
themselves. Ladies who yawn in their elegantly furnished
parlors, among books and pictures, if they have not company,
parties, or opera to diversify the evening, seem astonished
and half indignant that cook and chambermaid are more
disposed to go out for an evening gossip than to sit on hard
chairs in the kitchen where they have been toiling all day.
The pretty chambermaid&rsquo;s anxieties about her dress, the
time she spends at her small and not very clear mirror, are
sneeringly noticed by those whose toilet-cares take up serious
hours; and the question has never apparently occurred to
them why a serving-maid should not want to look pretty as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
well as her mistress. She is a woman as well as they, with
all a woman&rsquo;s wants and weaknesses; and her dress is as
much to her as theirs to them.</p>
<p>A vast deal of trouble among servants arises from impertinent
interferences and petty tyrannical exactions on the
part of employers. Now the authority of the master and
mistress of a house in regard to their domestics extends
simply to the things they have contracted to do and the
hours during which they have contracted to serve; otherwise
than this, they have no more right to interfere with
them in the disposal of their time than with any mechanic
whom they employ. They have, indeed, a right to regulate
the hours of their own household, and servants can choose
between conformity to these hours and the loss of their situation;
but, within reasonable limits, their right to come
and go at their own discretion, in their own time, should be
unquestioned.</p>
<p>If employers are troubled by the fondness of their servants
for dancing, evening company, and late hours, the
proper mode of proceeding is to make these matters a subject
of distinct contract in hiring. The more strictly and
perfectly the business matters of the first engagement of
domestics are conducted, the more likelihood there is of
mutual quiet and satisfaction in the relation. It is quite
competent to every housekeeper to say what practices are
or are not consistent with the rules of her family, and what
will be inconsistent with the service for which she agrees
to pay. It is much better to regulate such affairs by cool
contract in the outset than by warm altercations and protracted
domestic battles.</p>
<p>As to the terms of social intercourse, it seems somehow
to be settled in the minds of many employers that their
servants owe them and their family more respect than they
and the family owe to the servants. But do they? What
is the relation of servant to employer in a democratic country?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Precisely that of a person who for money performs
any kind of service for you. The carpenter comes into your
house to put up a set of shelves,&mdash;the cook comes into
your kitchen to cook your dinner. You never think that
the carpenter owes you any more respect than you owe to
him because he is in your house doing your behests; he is
your fellow-citizen, you treat him with respect, you expect
to be treated with respect by him. You have a claim on
him that he shall do your work according to your directions,&mdash;no
more. Now I apprehend that there is a very common
notion as to the position and rights of servants which is
quite different from this. Is it not a common feeling that
a servant is one who may be treated with a degree of freedom
by every member of the family which he or she may
not return? Do not people feel at liberty to question servants
about their private affairs, to comment on their dress
and appearance, in a manner which they would feel to be an
impertinence if reciprocated? Do they not feel at liberty
to express dissatisfaction with their performances in rude
and unceremonious terms, to reprove them in the presence
of company, while yet they require that the dissatisfaction
of servants shall be expressed only in terms of respect?
A woman would not feel herself at liberty to talk to her
milliner or her dressmaker in language as devoid of consideration
as she will employ towards her cook or chambermaid.
Yet both are rendering her a service which she pays for in
money, and one is no more made her inferior thereby than
the other. Both have an equal right to be treated with
courtesy. The master and mistress of a house have a right
to require respectful treatment from all whom their roof
shelters, but they have no more right to exact it of servants
than of every guest and every child, and they themselves
owe it as much to servants as to guests.</p>
<p>In order that servants may be treated with respect and
courtesy, it is not necessary, as in simpler patriarchal days,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
that they sit at the family table. Your carpenter or plumber
does not feel hurt that you do not ask him to dine with
you, nor your milliner and mantua-maker that you do not
exchange ceremonious calls and invite them to your parties.
It is well understood that your relations with them are of a
mere business character. They never take it as an assumption
of superiority on your part that you do not admit them
to relations of private intimacy. There may be the most
perfect respect and esteem and even friendship between them
and you, notwithstanding. So it may be in the case of
servants. It is easy to make any person understand that
there are quite other reasons than the assumption of personal
superiority for not wishing to admit servants to the family
privacy. It was not, in fact, to sit in the parlor or at the
table, in themselves considered, that was the thing aimed
at by New England girls,&mdash;these were valued only as signs
that they were deemed worthy of respect and consideration,
and, where freely conceded, were often in point of fact
declined.</p>
<p>Let servants feel, in their treatment by their employers,
and in the atmosphere of the family, that their position is
held to be a respectable one, let them feel in the mistress
of the family the charm of unvarying consideration and
good manners, let their work rooms be made convenient and
comfortable, and their private apartments bear some reasonable
comparison in point of agreeableness to those of other
members of the family, and domestic service will be more
frequently sought by a superior and self-respecting class.
There are families in which such a state of things prevails;
and such families, amid the many causes which unite to
make the tenure of service uncertain, have generally been
able to keep good permanent servants.</p>
<p>There is an extreme into which kindly disposed people
often run with regard to servants, which may be mentioned
here. They make pets of them. They give extravagant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
wages and indiscreet indulgences, and, through indolence
and easiness of temper, tolerate neglect of duty. Many of
the complaints of the ingratitude of servants come from
those who have spoiled them in this way; while many of
the longest and most harmonious domestic unions have
sprung from a simple, quiet course of Christian justice and
benevolence, a recognition of servants as fellow-beings and
fellow-Christians, and a doing to them as we would in like
circumstances that they should do to us.</p>
<p>The mistresses of American families, whether they like
it or not, have the duties of missionaries imposed upon them
by that class from which our supply of domestic servants is
drawn. They may as well accept the position cheerfully,
and, as one raw, untrained hand after another passes through
their family, and is instructed by them in the mysteries of
good housekeeping, comfort themselves with the reflection
that they are doing something to form good wives and
mothers for the Republic.</p>
<p>The complaints made of Irish girls are numerous and
loud; the failings of green Erin, alas! are but too open and
manifest; yet, in arrest of judgment, let us move this consideration:
let us imagine our own daughters between the
ages of sixteen and twenty-four, untaught and inexperienced
in domestic affairs as they commonly are, shipped to a foreign
shore to seek service in families. It may be questioned
whether as a whole they would do much better. The girls
that fill our families and do our housework are often of the
age of our own daughters, standing for themselves, without
mothers to guide them, in a foreign country, not only
bravely supporting themselves, but sending home in every
ship remittances to impoverished friends left behind. If our
daughters did as much for us, should we not be proud of
their energy and heroism?</p>
<p>When we go into the houses of our country, we find a
majority of well-kept, well-ordered, and even elegant establishments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
where the only hands employed are those of the
daughters of Erin. True, American women have been their
instructors, and many a weary hour of care have they had
in the discharge of this office; but the result on the whole
is beautiful and good, and the end of it, doubtless, will be
peace.</p>
<p>In speaking of the office of the American mistress as
being a missionary one, we are far from recommending any
controversial interference with the religious faith of our
servants. It is far better to incite them to be good Christians
in their own way than to run the risk of shaking their
faith in all religion by pointing out to them the errors of
that in which they have been educated. The general purity
of life and propriety of demeanor of so many thousands of
undefended young girls cast yearly upon our shores, with
no home but their church, and no shield but their religion,
are a sufficient proof that this religion exerts an influence
over them not to be lightly trifled with. But there is a
real unity even in opposite Christian forms; and the Roman
Catholic servant and the Protestant mistress, if alike possessed
by the spirit of Christ, and striving to conform to the
Golden Rule, cannot help being one in heart, though one go
to mass and the other to meeting.</p>
<p>Finally, the bitter baptism through which we are passing,
the life blood dearer than our own which is drenching distant
fields, should remind us of the preciousness of distinctive
American ideas. They who would seek in their foolish
pride to establish the pomp of liveried servants in America
are doing that which is simply absurd. A servant can never
in our country be the mere appendage to another man, to be
marked like a sheep with the color of his owner; he must be
a fellow-citizen, with an established position of his own, free
to make contracts, free to come and go, and having in his
sphere titles to consideration and respect just as definite as
those of any trade or profession whatever.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>Moreover, we cannot in this country maintain to any great
extent large retinues of servants. Even with ample fortunes
they are forbidden by the general character of society
here, which makes them cumbrous and difficult to manage.
Every mistress of a family knows that her cares increase
with every additional servant. Two keep the peace with
each other and their employer; three begin a possible discord,
which possibility increases with four, and becomes
certain with five or six. Trained housekeepers, such as
regulate the complicated establishments of the Old World,
form a class that are not, and from the nature of the case
never will be, found in any great numbers in this country.
All such women, as a general thing, are keeping, and prefer
to keep, houses of their own.</p>
<p>A moderate style of housekeeping, small, compact, and
simple domestic establishments, must necessarily be the
general order of life in America. So many openings of
profit are to be found in this country that domestic service
necessarily wants the permanence which forms so agreeable
a feature of it in the Old World. This being the case, it
should be an object in America to exclude from the labors
of the family all that can, with greater advantage, be executed
out of it by combined labor.</p>
<p>Formerly, in New England, soap and candles were to be
made in each separate family; now, comparatively few take
this toil upon them. We buy soap of the soap-maker, and
candles of the candle-factor. This principle might be extended
much further. In France no family makes its own
bread, and better bread cannot be eaten than what can be
bought at the appropriate shops. No family does its own
washing; the family&rsquo;s linen is all sent to women who, making
this their sole profession, get it up with a care and
nicety which can seldom be equaled in any family.</p>
<p>How would it simplify the burdens of the American
housekeeper to have washing and ironing day expunged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
from her calendar! How much more neatly and compactly
could the whole domestic system be arranged! If all the
money that each separate family spends on the outfit and
accommodations for washing and ironing, on fuel, soap,
starch, and the other et ceteras, were united in a fund to
create a laundry for every dozen families, one or two good
women could do in firstrate style what now is very indifferently
done by the disturbance and disarrangement of all
other domestic processes in these families. Whoever sets
neighborhood laundries on foot will do much to solve the
American housekeeper&rsquo;s hardest problem.</p>
<p>Finally, American women must not try with three servants
to carry on life in the style which in the Old World
requires sixteen: they must thoroughly understand, and
be prepared <i>to teach</i>, every branch of housekeeping; they
must study to make domestic service desirable by treating
their servants in a way to lead them to respect themselves
and to feel themselves respected; and there will gradually
be evolved from the present confusion a solution of the
domestic problem which shall be adapted to the life of a new
and growing world.</p>

<h3>X <br /><br />COOKERY</h3>
</div>
<p>My wife and I were sitting at the open bow-window of
my study, watching the tuft of bright-red leaves on our
favorite maple, which warned us that summer was over.
I was solacing myself, like all the world in our days, with
reading the &ldquo;Schönberg Cotta Family,&rdquo; when my wife
made her voice heard through the enchanted distance, and
dispersed the pretty vision of German cottage life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the day of the month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now my wife knows this is a thing that I never do know,
that I can&rsquo;t know, and in fact that there is no need I
should trouble myself about, since she always knows, and,
what is more, always tells me. In fact, the question, when
asked by her, meant more than met the ear. It was a
delicate way of admonishing me that another paper for
the &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; ought to be in train; and so I answered,
not to the external form, but to the internal intention,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my dear, I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind
what my next paper shall be about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, then, you let me give you a subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sovereign lady, speak on! Your slave hears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, take <i>Cookery</i>. It may seem a vulgar subject,
but I think more of health and happiness depends on
that than on any other one thing. You may make houses
enchantingly beautiful, hang them with pictures, have them
clean and airy and convenient; but if the stomach is fed with
sour bread and burnt coffee, it will raise such rebellions
that the eyes will see no beauty anywhere. Now, in the
little tour that you and I have been taking this summer, I
have been thinking of the great abundance of splendid
material we have in America, compared with the poor
cooking. How often, in our stoppings, we have sat down
to tables loaded with material, originally of the very best
kind, which had been so spoiled in the treatment that there
was really nothing to eat! Green biscuits with acrid spots
of alkali; sour yeast-bread; meat slowly simmered in fat
till it seemed like grease itself, and slowly congealing in
cold grease; and, above all, that unpardonable enormity,
strong butter! How often I have longed to show people
what might have been done with the raw material out of
which all these monstrosities were concocted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are driving me upon delicate
ground. Would you have your husband appear in public
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
with that most opprobrious badge of the domestic furies, a
dishcloth, pinned to his coat-tail? It is coming to exactly
the point I have always predicted, Mrs. Crowfield: you
must write yourself. I always told you that you could
write far better than I, if you would only try. Only sit
down and write as you sometimes talk to me, and I might
hang up my pen by the side of &lsquo;Uncle Ned&rsquo;s&rsquo; fiddle and
bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;I never could write.
I know what ought to be said, and I could <i>say</i> it to any
one; but my ideas freeze in the pen, cramp in my fingers,
and make my brain seem like heavy bread. I was born for
extemporary speaking. Besides, I think the best things on
all subjects in this world of ours are said, not by the practical
workers, but by the careful observers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Crowfield, that remark is as good as if I had
made it myself,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is true that I have been all
my life a speculator and observer in all domestic matters,
having them so confidentially under my eye in our own
household; and so, if I write on a pure woman&rsquo;s matter, it
must be understood that I am only your pen and mouthpiece,&mdash;only
giving tangible form to wisdom which I have
derived from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So down I sat and scribbled, while my sovereign lady
quietly stitched by my side. And here I tell my reader
that I write on such a subject under protest,&mdash;declaring
again my conviction that, if my wife only believed in herself
as firmly as I do, she would write so that nobody would
ever want to listen to me again.</p>
<h4>COOKERY</h4>
<p>We in America have the raw material of provision in
greater abundance than any other nation. There is no country
where an ample, well-furnished table is more easily
spread, and for that reason, perhaps, none where the bounties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of Providence are more generally neglected. I do not
mean to say that the traveler through the length and
breadth of our land could not, on the whole, find an average
of comfortable subsistence; yet, considering that our
resources are greater than those of any other civilized people,
our results are comparatively poorer.</p>
<p>It is said that, a list of the summer vegetables which
are exhibited on New York hotel tables being shown to a
French <i>artiste</i>, he declared that to serve such a dinner properly
would take till midnight. I recollect how I was once
struck with our national plenteousness on returning from a
Continental tour, and going directly from the ship to a New
York hotel, in the bounteous season of autumn. For
months I had been habituated to my neat little bits of chop
or poultry garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato,
which seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign
of green peas was over. Now I sat down all at once to a
carnival of vegetables,&mdash;ripe, juicy tomatoes, raw or cooked;
cucumbers in brittle slices; rich, yellow sweet potatoes;
broad Lima-beans, and beans of other and various names;
tempting ears of Indian corn steaming in enormous piles,
and great smoking tureens of the savory succotash, an Indian
gift to the table for which civilization need not blush;
sliced egg-plant in delicate fritters; and marrow squashes,
of creamy pulp and sweetness: a rich variety, embarrassing
to the appetite, and perplexing to the choice. Verily, the
thought has often impressed itself on my mind that the
vegetarian doctrine preached in America left a man quite as
much as he had capacity to eat or enjoy, and that in the
midst of such tantalizing abundance he really lost the apology
which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his
less gifted and accomplished animal neighbors.</p>
<p>But with all this, the American table, taken as a whole,
is inferior to that of England or France. It presents a fine
abundance of material, carelessly and poorly treated. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
management of food is nowhere in the world, perhaps, more
slovenly and wasteful. Everything betokens that want
of care that waits on abundance; there are great capabilities
and poor execution. A tourist through England can
seldom fail, at the quietest country inn, of finding himself
served with the essentials of English table comfort,&mdash;his
mutton-chop done to a turn, his steaming little private apparatus
for concocting his own tea, his choice pot of marmalade
or slice of cold ham, and his delicate rolls and creamy
butter, all served with care and neatness. In France, one
never asks in vain for delicious <i>café-au-lait</i>, good bread and
butter, a nice omelet, or some savory little portion of meat
with a French name. But to a tourist taking like chance
in American country fare, what is the prospect? What is
the coffee? what the tea? and the meat? and, above all,
the butter?</p>
<p>In lecturing on cookery, as on housebuilding, I divide
the subject into, not four, but five grand elements: first,
Bread; second, Butter; third, Meat; fourth, Vegetables;
and fifth, Tea,&mdash;by which I mean, generically, all sorts of
warm, comfortable drinks served out in teacups, whether
they be called tea, coffee, chocolate, broma, or what not.</p>
<p>I affirm that, if these five departments are all perfect,
the great ends of domestic cookery are answered, so far as
the comfort and well-being of life are concerned. I am
aware that there exists another department, which is often
regarded by culinary amateurs and young aspirants as the
higher branch and very collegiate course of practical cookery;
to wit, confectionery, by which I mean to designate
all pleasing and complicated compounds of sweets and
spices, devised not for health and nourishment, and strongly
suspected of interfering with both,&mdash;mere tolerated gratifications
of the palate, which we eat, not with the expectation
of being benefited, but only with the hope of not being injured
by them. In this large department rank all sorts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
cakes, pies, preserves, ices, etc. I shall have a word or two
to say under this head before I have done. I only remark
now that, in my tours about the country, I have often had
a virulent ill-will excited towards these works of culinary
supererogation, because I thought their excellence was attained
by treading under foot and disregarding the five
grand essentials. I have sat at many a table garnished
with three or four kinds of well-made cake, compounded
with citron and spices and all imaginable good things,
where the meat was tough and greasy, the bread some hot
preparation of flour, lard, saleratus, and acid, and the butter
unutterably detestable. At such tables I have thought
that, if the mistress of the feast had given the care, time,
and labor to preparing the simple items of bread, butter,
and meat that she evidently had given to the preparation
of these extras, the lot of a traveler might be much more
comfortable. Evidently she never had thought of these
common articles as constituting a good table. So long as
she had puff pastry, rich black cake, clear jelly, and preserves,
she seemed to consider that such unimportant matters
as bread, butter, and meat could take care of themselves.
It is the same inattention to common things as
that which leads people to build houses with stone fronts
and window-caps and expensive front-door trimmings, without
bathing-rooms or fireplaces or ventilators.</p>
<p>Those who go into the country looking for summer board
in farmhouses know perfectly well that a table where the
butter is always fresh, the tea and coffee of the best kinds
and well made, and the meats properly kept, dressed, and
served, is the one table of a hundred, the fabulous enchanted
island. It seems impossible to get the idea into
the minds of people that what is called common food,
carefully prepared, becomes, in virtue of that very care and
attention, a delicacy, superseding the necessity of artificially
compounded dainties.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>To begin, then, with the very foundation of a good table,&mdash;<i>Bread</i>:
What ought it to be? It should be light,
sweet, and tender.</p>
<p>This matter of lightness is the distinctive line between
savage and civilized bread. The savage mixes simple flour
and water into balls of paste, which he throws into boiling
water, and which come out solid, glutinous masses, of which
his common saying is, &ldquo;Man eat dis, he no die,&rdquo;&mdash;which a
facetious traveler who was obliged to subsist on it interpreted
to mean, &ldquo;Dis no kill you, nothing will.&rdquo; In short,
it requires the stomach of a wild animal or of a savage to
digest this primitive form of bread, and of course more or
less attention in all civilized modes of bread making is given
to producing lightness. By lightness is meant simply that
the particles are to be separated from each other by little
holes or air-cells; and all the different methods of making
light bread are neither more nor less than the formation in
bread of these air-cells.</p>
<p>So far as we know, there are four practicable methods
of aerating bread, namely, by fermentation; by effervescence
of an acid and an alkali; by aerated egg, or egg
which has been filled with air by the process of beating;
and, lastly, by pressure of some gaseous substance into the
paste, by a process much resembling the impregnation of
water in a soda fountain. All these have one and the same
object,&mdash;to give us the cooked particles of our flour separated
by such permanent air-cells as will enable the stomach
more readily to digest them.</p>
<p>A very common mode of aerating bread in America is
by the effervescence of an acid and an alkali in the flour.
The carbonic acid gas thus formed produces minute air-cells
in the bread, or, as the cook says, makes it light. When
this process is performed with exact attention to chemical
laws, so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize each
other, leaving no overplus of either, the result is often very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
palatable. The difficulty is, that this is a happy conjunction
of circumstances which seldom occurs. The acid most
commonly employed is that of sour milk, and, as milk has
many degrees of sourness, the rule of a certain quantity of
alkali to the pint must necessarily produce very different
results at different times. As an actual fact, where this
mode of making bread prevails, as we lament to say it does
to a great extent in this country, one finds five cases of
failure to one of success. It is a woful thing that the
daughters of New England have abandoned the old respectable
mode of yeast brewing and bread raising for this
specious substitute, so easily made, and so seldom well
made. The green, clammy, acrid substance called biscuit,
which many of our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in
these days, is wholly unworthy of the men and women of
the Republic. Good patriots ought not to be put off in
that way,&mdash;they deserve better fare.</p>
<p>As an occasional variety, as a household convenience for
obtaining bread or biscuit at a moment&rsquo;s notice, the process
of effervescence may be retained; but we earnestly entreat
American housekeepers, in Scriptural language, to stand in
the way and ask for the old paths, and return to the good
yeast-bread of their sainted grandmothers.</p>
<p>If acid and alkali must be used, by all means let them
be mixed in due proportions. No cook should be left to
guess and judge for herself about this matter. There is an
article, called &ldquo;Preston&rsquo;s Infallible Yeast Powder,&rdquo; which
is made by chemical rule, and produces very perfect results.
The use of this obviates the worst dangers in making bread
by effervescence.</p>
<p>Of all processes of aeration in bread-making, the oldest
and most time-honored is by fermentation. That this was
known in the days of our Saviour is evident from the forcible
simile in which he compares the silent permeating force
of truth in human society to the very familiar household
process of raising bread by a little yeast.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>There is, however, one species of yeast, much used in
some parts of the country, against which I have to enter
my protest. It is called salt-risings, or milk-risings, and is
made by mixing flour, milk, and a little salt together and
leaving them to ferment. The bread thus produced is often
very attractive, when new and made with great care. It is
white and delicate, with fine, even air-cells. It has, however,
when kept, some characteristics which remind us of
the terms in which our old English Bible describes the
effect of keeping the manna of the ancient Israelites, which
we are informed, in words more explicit than agreeable,
&ldquo;stank, and bred worms.&rdquo; If salt-rising bread does not
fulfill the whole of this unpleasant description, it certainly
does emphatically a part of it. The smell which it has in
baking, and when more than a day old, suggests the inquiry
whether it is the saccharine or the putrid fermentation
with which it is raised. Whoever breaks a piece of it
after a day or two will often see minute filaments or clammy
strings drawing out from the fragments, which, with the
unmistakable smell, will cause him to pause before consummating
a nearer acquaintance.</p>
<p>The fermentation of flour by means of brewer&rsquo;s or distiller&rsquo;s
yeast produces, if rightly managed, results far more
palatable and wholesome. The only requisites for success
in it are, first, good materials, and, second, great care in a
few small things. There are certain low-priced or damaged
kinds of flour which can never by any kind of domestic
chemistry be made into good bread; and to those persons
whose stomachs forbid them to eat gummy, glutinous paste,
under the name of bread, there is no economy in buying
these poor brands, even at half the price of good flour.</p>
<p>But good flour and good yeast being supposed, with a
temperature favorable to the development of fermentation,
the whole success of the process depends on the thorough
diffusion of the proper proportion of yeast through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
whole mass, and on stopping the subsequent fermentation
at the precise and fortunate point. The true housewife
makes her bread the sovereign of her kitchen,&mdash;its behests
must be attended to in all critical points and moments, no
matter what else be postponed. She who attends to her
bread when she has done this, and arranged that, and performed
the other, very often finds that the forces of nature
will not wait for her. The snowy mass, perfectly mixed,
kneaded with care and strength, rises in its beautiful perfection
till the moment comes for fixing the air-cells by
baking. A few minutes now, and the acetous fermentation
will begin, and the whole result be spoiled. Many bread-makers
pass in utter carelessness over this sacred and mysterious
boundary. Their oven has cake in it, or they are
skimming jelly, or attending to some other of the so-called
higher branches of cookery, while the bread is quickly
passing into the acetous stage. At last, when they are
ready to attend to it, they find that it has been going its
own way,&mdash;it is so sour that the pungent smell is plainly
perceptible. Now the saleratus-bottle is handed down, and
a quantity of the dissolved alkali mixed with the paste,&mdash;an
expedient sometimes making itself too manifest by
greenish streaks or small acrid spots in the bread. As the
result, we have a beautiful article spoiled,&mdash;bread without
sweetness, if not absolutely sour.</p>
<p>In the view of many, lightness is the only property
required in this article. The delicate, refined sweetness
which exists in carefully kneaded bread, baked just before
it passes to the extreme point of fermentation, is something
of which they have no conception; and thus they will even
regard this process of spoiling the paste by the acetous fermentation,
and then rectifying that acid by effervescence
with an alkali, as something positively meritorious. How
else can they value and relish baker&rsquo;s loaves, such as some
are, drugged with ammonia and other disagreeable things,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
light indeed, so light that they seem to have neither weight
nor substance, but with no more sweetness or taste than so
much white cotton?</p>
<p>Some persons prepare bread for the oven by simply mixing
it in the mass, without kneading, pouring it into pans,
and suffering it to rise there. The air-cells in bread thus
prepared are coarse and uneven; the bread is as inferior in
delicacy and nicety to that which is well kneaded as a raw
Irish servant to a perfectly educated and refined lady. The
process of kneading seems to impart an evenness to the
minute air-cells, a fineness of texture, and a tenderness and
pliability to the whole substance, that can be gained in no
other way.</p>
<p>The divine principle of beauty has its reign over bread as
well as over all other things; it has its laws of &aelig;sthetics;
and that bread which is so prepared that it can be formed
into separate and well-proportioned loaves, each one carefully
worked and moulded, will develop the most beautiful results.
After being moulded, the loaves should stand a little
while, just long enough to allow the fermentation going on
in them to expand each little air-cell to the point at which
it stood before it was worked down, and then they should
be immediately put into the oven.</p>
<p>Many a good thing, however, is spoiled in the oven. We
cannot but regret, for the sake of bread, that our old steady
brick ovens have been almost universally superseded by those
of ranges and cooking-stoves, which are infinite in their
caprices, and forbid all general rules. One thing, however,
may be borne in mind as a principle,&mdash;that the excellence
of bread in all its varieties, plain or sweetened, depends on
the perfection of its air-cells, whether produced by yeast,
egg, or effervescence; that one of the objects of baking is to
fix these air-cells, and that the quicker this can be done
through the whole mass, the better will the result be.
When cake or bread is made heavy by baking too quickly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
it is because the immediate formation of the top crust hinders
the exhaling of the moisture in the centre, and prevents
the air-cells from cooking. The weight also of the crust
pressing down on the doughy air-cells below destroys them,
producing that horror of good cooks, a heavy streak. The
problem in baking, then, is the quick application of heat
rather below than above the loaf, and its steady continuance
till all the air-cells are thoroughly dried into permanent
consistency. Every housewife must watch her own oven to
know how this can be best accomplished.</p>
<p>Bread-making can be cultivated to any extent as a fine
art; and the various kinds of biscuit, tea-rusks, twists, rolls,
into which bread may be made, are much better worth a
housekeeper&rsquo;s ambition than the getting up of rich and expensive
cake or confections. There are also varieties of
material which are rich in good effects. Unbolted flour,
altogether more wholesome than the fine wheat, and when
properly prepared more palatable, rye-flour and corn-meal,
each affording a thousand attractive possibilities,&mdash;each and
all of these come under the general laws of breadstuffs, and
are worth a careful attention.</p>
<p>A peculiarity of our American table, particularly in the
Southern and Western States, is the constant exhibition of
various preparations of hot bread. In many families of the
South and West, bread in loaves to be eaten cold is an article
quite unknown. The effect of this kind of diet upon
the health has formed a frequent subject of remark among
travelers; but only those know the full mischiefs of it who
have been compelled to sojourn for a length of time in
families where it is maintained. The unknown horrors of
dyspepsia from bad bread are a topic over which we willingly
draw a veil.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Next to bread comes <i>butter</i>,&mdash;on which we have to say
that, when we remember what butter is in civilized Europe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
and compare it with what it is in America, we wonder at
the forbearance and lenity of travelers in their strictures on
our national commissariat.</p>
<p>Butter in England, France, and Italy is simply solidified
cream, with all the sweetness of the cream in its taste,
freshly churned each day, and unadulterated by salt. At
the present moment, when salt is five cents a pound and
butter fifty, we Americans are paying, I should judge from
the taste, for about one pound of salt to every ten of butter,
and those of us who have eaten the butter of France and
England do this with rueful recollections.</p>
<p>There is, it is true, an article of butter made in the American
style with salt, which, in its own kind and way, has a
merit not inferior to that of England and France. Many
prefer it, and it certainly takes a rank equally respectable
with the other. It is yellow, hard, and worked so perfectly
free from every particle of buttermilk that it might make
the voyage of the world without spoiling. It is salted, but
salted with care and delicacy, so that it may be a question
whether even a fastidious Englishman might not prefer its
golden solidity to the white, creamy freshness of his own.
Now I am not for universal imitation of foreign customs, and
where I find this butter made perfectly I call it our American
style, and am not ashamed of it. I only regret that
this article is the exception, and not the rule, on our tables.
When I reflect on the possibilities which beset the delicate
stomach in this line, I do not wonder that my venerated
friend Dr. Mussey used to close his counsels to invalids with
the direction, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t eat grease on your bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>America must, I think, have the credit of manufacturing
and putting into market more bad butter than all that is
made in all the rest of the world together. The varieties of
bad tastes and smells which prevail in it are quite a study.
This has a cheesy taste, that a mouldy,&mdash;this is flavored
with cabbage, and that again with turnip; and another has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the strong, sharp savor of rancid animal fat. These varieties,
I presume, come from the practice of churning only at
long intervals, and keeping the cream meanwhile in unventilated
cellars or dairies, the air of which is loaded with the
effluvia of vegetable substances. No domestic articles are
so sympathetic as those of the milk tribe: they readily take
on the smell and taste of any neighboring substance, and
hence the infinite variety of flavors on which one mournfully
muses who has late in autumn to taste twenty firkins of
butter in hopes of finding one which will simply not be intolerable
on his winter table.</p>
<p>A matter for despair as regards bad butter is that, at the
tables where it is used, it stands sentinel at the door to bar
your way to every other kind of food. You turn from your
dreadful half-slice of bread, which fills your mouth with
bitterness, to your beefsteak, which proves virulent with
the same poison; you think to take refuge in vegetable
diet, and find the butter in the string-beans, and polluting
the innocence of early peas; it is in the corn, in the
succotash, in the squash; the beets swim in it, the onions
have it poured over them. Hungry and miserable, you
think to solace yourself at the dessert; but the pastry is
cursed, the cake is acrid with the same plague. You are
ready to howl with despair, and your misery is great upon
you, especially if this is a table where you have taken
board for three months with your delicate wife and four
small children. Your case is dreadful,&mdash;and it is hopeless,
because long usage and habit have rendered your host perfectly
incapable of discovering what is the matter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
like the butter, sir? I assure you I paid an extra price
for it, and it&rsquo;s the very best in the market. I looked over
as many as a hundred tubs, and picked out this one.&rdquo; You
are dumb, but not less despairing.</p>
<p>Yet the process of making good butter is a very simple
one. To keep the cream in a perfectly pure, cool atmosphere,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
to churn while it is yet sweet, to work out the buttermilk
thoroughly, and to add salt with such discretion as not
to ruin the fine, delicate flavor of the fresh cream,&mdash;all this
is quite simple, so simple that one wonders at thousands
and millions of pounds of butter yearly manufactured which
are merely a hobgoblin-bewitchment of cream into foul and
loathsome poisons.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>The third head of my discourse is that of <i>Meat</i>, of which
America furnishes, in the gross material, enough to spread
our tables royally, were it well cared for and served.</p>
<p>The faults in the meat generally furnished to us are, first,
that it is too new. A beefsteak, which three or four days
of keeping might render practicable, is served up to us palpitating
with freshness, with all the toughness of animal
muscle yet warm. In the Western country, the traveler,
on approaching an hotel, is often saluted by the last shrieks
of the chickens which half an hour afterward are presented
to him à la spread-eagle for his dinner. The example of
the Father of the Faithful, most wholesome to be followed
in so many respects, is imitated only in the celerity with
which the young calf, tender and good, was transformed into
an edible dish for hospitable purposes. But what might be
good housekeeping in a nomadic Emir, in days when refrigerators
were yet in the future, ought not to be so closely
imitated as it often is in our own land.</p>
<p>In the next place, there is a woful lack of nicety in the
butcher&rsquo;s work of cutting and preparing meat. Who that
remembers the neatly trimmed mutton-chop of an English
inn, or the artistic little circle of lamb-chop fried in bread-crumbs
coiled around a tempting centre of spinach which
can always be found in France, can recognize any family
resemblance to these dapper civilized preparations in those
coarse, roughly hacked strips of bone, gristle, and meat
which are commonly called mutton-chop in America? There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
seems to be a large dish of something resembling meat, in
which each fragment has about two or three edible morsels,
the rest being composed of dry and burnt skin, fat, and
ragged bone.</p>
<p>Is it not time that civilization should learn to demand
somewhat more care and nicety in the modes of preparing
what is to be cooked and eaten? Might not some of the
refinement and trimness which characterize the preparations
of the European market be with advantage introduced into
our own? The housekeeper who wishes to garnish her
table with some of those nice things is stopped in the outset
by the butcher. Except in our large cities, where some
foreign travel may have created the demand, it seems impossible
to get much in this line that is properly prepared.</p>
<p>I am aware that, if this is urged on the score of &aelig;sthetics,
the ready reply will be, &ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t give time here in
America to go into niceties and French whim-whams!&rdquo;
But the French mode of doing almost all practical things is
based on that true philosophy and utilitarian good sense
which characterize that seemingly thoughtless people. Nowhere
is economy a more careful study, and their market is
artistically arranged to this end. The rule is so to cut their
meats that no portion designed to be cooked in a certain manner
shall have wasteful appendages which that mode of cooking
will spoil. The French soup kettle stands ever ready
to receive the bones, the thin fibrous flaps, the sinewy and
gristly portions, which are so often included in our roasts
or broilings, which fill our plates with unsightly débris, and
finally make an amount of blank waste for which we pay our
butcher the same price that we pay for what we have eaten.</p>
<p>The dead waste of our clumsy, coarse way of cutting
meats is immense. For example, at the beginning of the
present season, the part of a lamb denominated leg and loin,
or hind-quarter, sold for thirty cents a pound. Now this
includes, besides the thick, fleshy portions, a quantity of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
bone, sinew, and thin fibrous substance, constituting full
one third of the whole weight. If we put it into the oven
entire, in the usual manner, we have the thin parts overdone,
and the skinny and fibrous parts utterly dried up, by
the application of the amount of heat necessary to cook the
thick portion. Supposing the joint to weigh six pounds,
at thirty cents, and that one third of the weight is so treated
as to become perfectly useless, we throw away sixty cents.
Of a piece of beef at twenty-five cents a pound, fifty cents&rsquo;
worth is often lost in bone, fat, and burnt skin.</p>
<p>The fact is, this way of selling and cooking meat in large,
gross portions is of English origin, and belongs to a country
where all the customs of society spring from a class who
have no particular occasion for economy. The practice of
minute and delicate division comes from a nation which
acknowledges the need of economy, and has made it a study.
A quarter of lamb in this mode of division would be sold
in three nicely prepared portions. The thick part would
be sold by itself, for a neat, compact little roast; the rib-bones
would be artistically separated, and all the edible
matters scraped away would form those delicate dishes of
lamb-chop which, fried in bread-crumbs to a golden brown,
are so ornamental and so palatable a side-dish; the trimmings
which remain after this division would be destined to
the soup kettle or stew pan. In a French market is a little
portion for every purse, and the far-famed and delicately
flavored soups and stews which have arisen out of French
economy are a study worth a housekeeper&rsquo;s attention. Not
one atom of food is wasted in the French modes of preparation;
even tough animal cartilages and sinews, instead of
appearing burnt and blackened in company with the roast
meat to which they happen to be related, are treated according
to their own laws, and come out either in savory soups,
or those fine, clear meat-jellies which form a garnish no less
agreeable to the eye than palatable to the taste.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>Whether this careful, economical, practical style of meat
cooking can ever to any great extent be introduced into our
kitchens now is a question. Our butchers are against it;
our servants are wedded to the old wholesale wasteful ways,
which seem to them easier because they are accustomed to
them. A cook who will keep and properly tend a soup
kettle which shall receive and utilize all that the coarse
preparations of the butcher would require her to trim away,
who understands the art of making the most of all these
remains, is a treasure scarcely to be hoped for. If such
things are to be done, it must be primarily through the
educated brain of cultivated women who do not scorn to
turn their culture and refinement upon domestic problems.</p>
<p>When meats have been properly divided&mdash;so that each
portion can receive its own appropriate style of treatment&mdash;next
comes the consideration of the modes of cooking.
These may be divided into two great general classes: those
where it is desired to keep the juices within the meat, as
in baking, broiling, and frying; and those whose object is
to extract the juice and dissolve the fibre, as in the making
of soups and stews. In the first class of operations, the
process must be as rapid as may consist with the thorough
cooking of all the particles. In this branch of cookery,
doing quickly is doing well. The fire must be brisk, the
attention alert. The introduction of cooking-stoves offers
to careless domestics facilities for gradually drying up meats,
and despoiling them of all flavor and nutriment,&mdash;facilities
which appear to be very generally laid hold of. They have
almost banished the genuine, old-fashioned roast meat from
our tables, and left in its stead dried meats with their most
precious and nutritive juices evaporated. How few cooks,
unassisted, are competent to the simple process of broiling
a beefsteak or mutton-chop! how very generally one has
to choose between these meats gradually dried away, or
burned on the outside and raw within! Yet in England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
these articles <i>never</i> come on table done amiss; their perfect
cooking is as absolute a certainty as the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>No one of these rapid processes of cooking, however, is
so generally abused as frying. The frying-pan has awful
sins to answer for. What untold horrors of dyspepsia have
arisen from its smoky depths, like the ghosts from witches&rsquo;
caldrons! The fizzle of frying meat is as a warning knell
on many an ear, saying, &ldquo;Touch not, taste not, if you would
not burn and writhe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet those who have traveled abroad remember that some
of the lightest, most palatable, and most digestible preparations
of meat have come from this dangerous source. But
we fancy quite other rites and ceremonies inaugurated the
process, and quite other hands performed its offices, than
those known to our kitchens. Probably the delicate <i>côte-lettes</i>
of France are not flopped down into half-melted grease,
there gradually to warm and soak and fizzle, while Biddy
goes in and out on her other ministrations, till finally, when
thoroughly saturated and dinner-hour impends, she bethinks
herself, and crowds the fire below to a roaring heat, and
finishes the process by a smart burn, involving the kitchen
and surrounding precincts in volumes of Stygian gloom.</p>
<p>From such preparations has arisen the very current medical
opinion that fried meats are indigestible. They are indigestible
if they are greasy; but French cooks have taught
us that a thing has no more need to be greasy because emerging
from grease than Venus had to be salt because she rose
from the sea.</p>
<p>There are two ways of frying employed by the French
cook. One is, to immerse the article to be cooked in <i>boiling</i>
fat, with an emphasis on the present participle,&mdash;and
the philosophical principle is, so immediately to crisp every
pore at the first moment or two of immersion as effectually to
seal the interior against the intrusion of greasy particles; it
can then remain as long as may be necessary thoroughly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
cook it, without imbibing any more of the boiling fluid than
if it were enclosed in an eggshell. The other method is, to
rub a perfectly smooth iron surface with just enough of some
oily substance to prevent the meat from adhering, and cook
it with a quick heat, as cakes are baked on a griddle. In
both these cases there must be the most rapid application of
heat that can be made without burning, and by the adroitness
shown in working out this problem the skill of the
cook is tested. Any one whose cook attains this important
secret will find fried things quite as digestible and often
more palatable than any other.</p>
<p>In the second department of meat cookery, to wit, the
slow and gradual application of heat for the softening and
dissolution of its fibre and the extraction of its juices, common
cooks are equally untrained. Where is the so-called
cook who understands how to prepare soups and stews?
These are precisely the articles in which a French kitchen
excels. The soup kettle, made with a double bottom to
prevent burning, is a permanent, ever-present institution,
and the coarsest and most impracticable meats distilled
through that alembic come out again in soups, jellies, or savory
stews. The toughest cartilage, even the bones, being
first cracked, are here made to give forth their hidden
virtues, and to rise in delicate and appetizing forms. One
great law governs all these preparations: the application of
heat must be gradual, steady, long protracted, never reaching
the point of active boiling. Hours of quiet simmering
dissolve all dissoluble parts, soften the sternest fibre, and
unlock every minute cell in which Nature has stored away
her treasures of nourishment. This careful and protracted
application of heat and the skillful use of flavors constitute
the two main points in all those nice preparations of meat
for which the French have so many names,&mdash;processes by
which a delicacy can be imparted to the coarsest and cheapest
food superior to that of the finest articles under less
philosophic treatment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>French soups and stews are a study, and they would
not be an unprofitable one to any person who wishes to live
with comfort and even elegance on small means.</p>
<p>John Bull looks down from the sublime of ten thousand
a year on French kickshaws, as he calls them: &ldquo;Give me
my meat cooked so I may know what it is!&rdquo; An ox
roasted whole is dear to John&rsquo;s soul, and his kitchen arrangements
are Titanic. What magnificent rounds and sirloins
of beef, revolving on self-regulating spits, with a rich click
of satisfaction, before grates piled with roaring fires! Let
us do justice to the royal cheer. Nowhere are the charms
of pure, unadulterated animal food set forth in more imposing
style. For John is rich, and what does he care for odds
and ends and parings? Has he not all the beasts of the
forest, and the cattle on a thousand hills? What does he
want of economy? But his brother Jean has not ten thousand
pounds a year,&mdash;nothing like it; but he makes up for
the slenderness of his purse by boundless fertility of invention
and delicacy of practice. John began sneering at Jean&rsquo;s
soups and ragouts, but all John&rsquo;s modern sons and daughters
send to Jean for their cooks, and the sirloins of England
rise up and do obeisance to this Joseph with a white apron
who comes to rule in their kitchens.</p>
<p>There is no animal fibre that will not yield itself up to
long-continued, steady heat. But the difficulty with almost
any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is,
that they have not the smallest notion of the philosophy of
the application of heat. Such a one will complacently tell
you, concerning certain meats, that the harder you boil them
the harder they grow,&mdash;an obvious fact, which, under her
mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil, has
frequently come under her personal observation. If you
tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat
just below the boiling-point, she will probably answer, &ldquo;Yes,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and go on her own way. Or she will let it stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
till it burns to the bottom of the kettle,&mdash;a most common
termination of the experiment. The only way to make sure
of the matter is either to import a French kettle, or to fit
into an ordinary kettle a false bottom, such as any tinman
may make, that shall leave a space of an inch or two between
the meat and the fire. This kettle may be maintained
as a constant <i>habitué</i> of the range, and into it the
cook may be instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings
of meat, all the gristle, tendons, and bones, having previously
broken up these last with a mallet.</p>
<p>Such a kettle will furnish the basis for clear, rich soups
or other palatable dishes. Clear soup consists of the dissolved
juices of the meat and gelatine of the bones, cleared
from the fat and fibrous portions by straining when cold.
The grease, which rises to the top of the fluid, may thus be
easily removed. In a stew, on the contrary, you boil down
this soup till it permeates the fibre which long exposure to
heat has softened. All that remains, after the proper preparation
of the fibre and juices, is the flavoring, and it is in
this, particularly, that French soups excel those of America
and England and all the world.</p>
<p>English and American soups are often heavy and hot with
spices. There are appreciable tastes in them. They burn
your mouth with cayenne or clove or allspice. You can tell
at once what is in them, oftentimes to your sorrow. But a
French soup has a flavor which one recognises at once as
delicious, yet not to be characterized as due to any single
condiment; it is the just blending of many things. The
same remark applies to all their stews, ragouts, and other
delicate preparations. No cook will ever study these flavors;
but perhaps many cooks&rsquo; mistresses may, and thus be able
to impart delicacy and comfort to economy.</p>
<p>As to those things called hashes, commonly manufactured
by unwatched, untaught cooks, out of the remains of yesterday&rsquo;s
repast, let us not dwell too closely on their memory,&mdash;compounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
of meat, gristle, skin, fat, and burnt fibre,
with a handful of pepper and salt flung at them, dredged
with lumpy flour, watered from the spout of the tea-kettle,
and left to simmer at the cook&rsquo;s convenience while she is
otherwise occupied. Such are the best performances a housekeeper
can hope for from an untrained cook.</p>
<p>But the cunningly devised minces, the artful preparations
choicely flavored, which may be made of yesterday&rsquo;s repast,&mdash;by
these is the true domestic artist known. No cook
untaught by an educated brain ever makes these, and yet
economy is a great gainer by them.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>As regards the department of <i>Vegetables</i>, their number
and variety in America are so great that a table might almost
be furnished by these alone. Generally speaking, their
cooking is a more simple art, and therefore more likely to be
found satisfactorily performed, than that of meats. If only
they are not drenched with rancid butter, their own native
excellence makes itself known in most of the ordinary modes
of preparation.</p>
<p>There is, however, one exception.</p>
<p>Our stanch old friend the potato is to other vegetables
what bread is on the table. Like bread, it is held as a sort
of <i>sine qua non</i>; like that, it may be made invariably palatable
by a little care in a few plain particulars, through
neglect of which it often becomes intolerable. The soggy,
waxy, indigestible viand that often appears in the potato-dish
is a downright sacrifice of the better nature of this vegetable.</p>
<p>The potato, nutritive and harmless as it appears, belongs
to a family suspected of very dangerous traits. It is a family
connection of the deadly nightshade and other ill-reputed
gentry, and sometimes shows strange proclivities to evil,&mdash;now
breaking out uproariously, as in the noted potato rot,
and now more covertly in various evil affections. For this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
reason, scientific directors bid us beware of the water in
which potatoes are boiled,&mdash;into which, it appears, the
evil principle is drawn off; and they caution us not to shred
them into stews without previously suffering the slices to
lie for an hour or so in salt and water. These cautions are
worth attention.</p>
<p>The most usual modes of preparing the potato for the
table are by roasting or boiling. These processes are so simple
that it is commonly supposed every cook understands
them without special directions, and yet there is scarcely
an uninstructed cook who can boil or roast a potato.</p>
<p>A good roasted potato is a delicacy worth a dozen compositions
of the cook-book; yet when we ask for it, what
burnt, shriveled abortions are presented to us! Biddy rushes
to her potato-basket and pours out two dozen of different
sizes, some having in them three times the amount of matter
of others. These being washed, she tumbles them into her
oven at a leisure interval, and there lets them lie till it is
time to serve breakfast, whenever that may be. As a result,
if the largest are cooked, the smallest are presented in
cinders, and the intermediate sizes are withered and watery.
Nothing is so utterly ruined by a few moments of overdoing.
That which at the right moment was plump with mealy richness,
a quarter of an hour later shrivels and becomes watery,&mdash;and
it is in this state that roast potatoes are most frequently
served.</p>
<p>In the same manner we have seen boiled potatoes from an
untaught cook coming upon the table like lumps of yellow
wax,&mdash;and the same article, the day after, under the directions
of a skillful mistress, appearing in snowy balls of powdery
lightness. In the one case, they were thrown in their
skins into water and suffered to soak or boil, as the case
might be, at the cook&rsquo;s leisure, and, after they were boiled,
to stand in the water till she was ready to peel them. In
the other case, the potatoes being first peeled were boiled as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
quickly as possible in salted water, which, the moment they
were done, was drained off, and then they were gently shaken
for a minute or two over the fire to dry them still more
thoroughly. We have never yet seen the potato so depraved
and given over to evil that could not be reclaimed by this
mode of treatment.</p>
<p>As to fried potatoes, who that remembers the crisp,
golden slices of the French restaurant, thin as wafers and
light as snowflakes, does not speak respectfully of them?
What cousinship with these have those coarse, greasy masses
of sliced potato, wholly soggy and partly burnt, to which we
are treated under the name of fried potatoes à la America?
In our cities the restaurants are introducing the French
article to great acceptance, and to the vindication of the
fair fame of this queen of vegetables.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Finally, I arrive at the last great head of my subject, to
wit, <i>Tea</i>,&mdash;meaning thereby, as before observed, what our
Hibernian friend did in the inquiry, &ldquo;Will y&rsquo;r Honor take
&lsquo;tay tay&rsquo; or &lsquo;coffee tay&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not about to enter into the merits of the great tea
and coffee controversy, or say whether these substances
are or are not wholesome. I treat of them as actual existences,
and speak only of the modes of making the most of
them.</p>
<p>The French coffee is reputed the best in the world; and
a thousand voices have asked, What is it about the French
coffee? In the first place, then, the French coffee is coffee,
and not chicory, or rye, or beans, or peas. In the second
place, it is freshly roasted, whenever made,&mdash;roasted with
great care and evenness in a little revolving cylinder which
makes part of the furniture of every kitchen, and which
keeps in the aroma of the berry. It is never overdone,
so as to destroy the coffee flavor, which is in nine cases out
of ten the fault of the coffee we meet with. Then it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
ground, and placed in a coffee-pot with a filter, through
which it percolates in clear drops&mdash;the coffee-pot standing
on a heated stove to maintain the temperature. The nose
of the coffee-pot is stopped up to prevent the escape of the
aroma during this process. The extract thus obtained is
a perfectly clear, dark fluid, know as <i>café noir</i>, or black
coffee. It is black only because of its strength, being in
fact almost the very essential oil of coffee. A tablespoonful
of this in boiled milk would make what is ordinarily called
a strong cup of coffee. The boiled milk is prepared with
no less care. It must be fresh and new, not merely warmed
or even brought to the boiling point, but slowly simmered
till it attains a thick, creamy richness. The coffee mixed
with this, and sweetened with that sparkling beet-root
sugar which ornaments a French table, is the celebrated
<i>café-au-lait</i>, the name of which has gone round the world.</p>
<p>As we look to France for the best coffee, so we must
look to England for the perfection of tea. The tea-kettle
is as much an English institution as aristocracy or the
Prayer Book; and when one wants to know exactly how
tea should be made, one has only to ask how a fine old
English housekeeper makes it.</p>
<p>The first article of her faith is, that the water must not
merely be hot, not merely <i>have boiled</i> a few moments since,
but be actually <i>boiling</i> at the moment it touches the tea.
Hence, though servants in England are vastly better trained
than with us, this delicate mystery is seldom left to their
hands. Tea making belongs to the drawing-room, and high-born
ladies preside at &ldquo;the bubbling and loud-hissing urn,&rdquo;
and see that all due rites and solemnities are properly performed,&mdash;that
the cups are hot, and that the infused tea
waits the exact time before the libations commence. Oh,
ye dear old English tea-tables, resorts of the kindest-hearted
hospitality in the world! we still cherish your memory,
even though you do not say pleasant things of us there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
One of these days you will think better of us. Of late,
the introduction of English breakfast tea has raised a new
sect among the tea drinkers, reversing some of the old canons.
Breakfast tea must be boiled! Unlike the delicate
article of olden time, which required only a momentary infusion
to develop its richness, this requires a longer and
severer treatment to bring out its strength,&mdash;thus confusing
all the established usages, and throwing the work into
the hands of the cook in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The faults of tea, as too commonly found at our hotels
and boarding-houses, are that it is made in every way the
reverse of what it should be. The water is hot, perhaps,
but not boiling; the tea has a general flat, stale, smoky
taste, devoid of life or spirit; and it is served, usually, with
thin milk instead of cream. Cream is as essential to the
richness of tea as of coffee. We could wish that the English
fashion might generally prevail, of giving the traveler his
own kettle of boiling water and his own tea-chest, and letting
him make tea for himself. At all events he would
then be sure of one merit in his tea,&mdash;it would be hot, a
very simple and obvious virtue, but one very seldom obtained.</p>
<p>Chocolate is a French and Spanish article, and one seldom
served on American tables. We in America, however,
make an article every way equal to any which can be imported
from Paris, and he who buys Baker&rsquo;s best vanilla-chocolate
may rest assured that no foreign land can furnish
anything better. A very rich and delicious beverage may
be made by dissolving this in milk slowly boiled down after
the French fashion.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>I have now gone over all the ground I laid out, as comprising
the great first principles of cookery; and I would
here modestly offer the opinion that a table where all these
principles are carefully observed would need few dainties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
The struggle after so-called delicacies comes from the poorness
of common things. Perfect bread and butter would
soon drive cake out of the field; it has done so in many
families. Nevertheless, I have a word to say under the
head of <i>Confectionery</i>, meaning by this the whole range
of ornamental cookery,&mdash;or pastry, ices, jellies, preserves,
etc. The art of making all these very perfectly is far better
understood in America than the art of common cooking.</p>
<p>There are more women who know how to make good
cake than good bread,&mdash;more who can furnish you with
a good ice-cream than a well-cooked mutton-chop; a fair
charlotte-russe is easier to come by than a perfect cup of
coffee; and you shall find a sparkling jelly to your dessert
where you sighed in vain for so simple a luxury as a well-cooked
potato.</p>
<p>Our fair countrywomen might rest upon their laurels in
these higher fields, and turn their great energy and ingenuity
to the study of essentials. To do common things perfectly
is far better worth our endeavor than to do uncommon things
respectably. We Americans in many things as yet have
been a little inclined to begin making our shirt at the ruffle;
but nevertheless, when we set about it, we can make the
shirt as nicely as anybody,&mdash;it needs only that we turn our
attention to it, resolved that, ruffle or no ruffle, the shirt
we will have.</p>
<p>I have also a few words to say as to the prevalent ideas
in respect to French cookery. Having heard much of it,
with no very distinct idea what it is, our people have somehow
fallen into the notion that its forte lies in high spicing,&mdash;and
so, when our cooks put a great abundance of clove,
mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon into their preparations, they
fancy that they are growing up to be French cooks. But
the fact is, that the Americans and English are far more
given to spicing than the French. Spices in our made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
dishes are abundant, and their taste is strongly pronounced.
In living a year in France I forgot the taste of nutmeg,
clove, and allspice, which had met me in so many dishes in
America.</p>
<p>The thing may be briefly defined. The English and
Americans deal in <i>spices</i>, the French in <i>flavors</i>,&mdash;flavors
many and subtile, imitating often in their delicacy those
subtile blendings which Nature produces in high-flavored
fruits. The recipes of our cookery-books are most of them
of English origin, coming down from the times of our
phlegmatic ancestors, when the solid, burly, beefy growth of
the foggy island required the heat of fiery condiments, and
could digest heavy sweets. Witness the national recipe for
plum-pudding, which may be rendered: Take a pound of
every indigestible substance you can think of, boil into a
cannon-ball, and serve in flaming brandy. So of the Christmas
mince-pie and many other national dishes. But in
America, owing to our brighter skies and more fervid
climate, we have developed an acute, nervous delicacy of
temperament far more akin to that of France than of England.</p>
<p>Half of the recipes in our cook-books are mere murder to
such constitutions and stomachs as we grow here. We require
to ponder these things, and think how we in our
climate and under our circumstances ought to live, and, in
doing so, we may, without accusation of foreign foppery,
take some leaves from many foreign books.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>But Christopher has prosed long enough. I must now
read this to my wife, and see what she says.</p>

<h3>XI <br /><br />OUR HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Our gallant Bob Stephens, into whose lifeboat our
Marianne has been received, has lately taken the mania of
housebuilding into his head. Bob is somewhat fastidious,
difficult to please, fond of domesticities and individualities;
and such a man never can fit himself into a house built by
another, and accordingly housebuilding has always been his
favorite mental recreation. During all his courtship, as
much time was taken up in planning a future house as if he
had money to build one; and all Marianne&rsquo;s patterns, and
the backs of half their letters, were scrawled with ground-plans
and elevations. But latterly this chronic disposition
has been quickened into an acute form by the falling-in of
some few thousands to their domestic treasury,&mdash;left as
the sole residuum of a painstaking old aunt, who took it
into her head to make a will in Bob&rsquo;s favor, leaving, among
other good things, a nice little bit of land in a rural district
half an hour&rsquo;s railroad ride from Boston.</p>
<p>So now ground-plans thicken, and my wife is being consulted
morning, noon, and night; and I never come into
the room without finding their heads close together over a
paper, and hearing Bob expatiate on his favorite idea of a
library. He appears to have got so far as this, that the
ceiling is to be of carved oak, with ribs running to a boss
overhead, and finished medi&aelig;vally with ultramarine blue
and gilding,&mdash;and then away he goes sketching Gothic
patterns of bookshelves which require only experienced
carvers, and the wherewithal to pay them, to be the divinest
things in the world.</p>
<p>Marianne is exercised about china-closets and pantries,
and about a bedroom on the ground-floor,&mdash;for, like all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
other women of our days, she expects not to have strength
enough to run upstairs oftener than once or twice a week;
and my wife, who is a native genius in this line, and has
planned in her time dozens of houses for acquaintances,
wherein they are at this moment living happily, goes over
every day with her pencil and ruler the work of rearranging
the plans, according as the ideas of the young couple veer
and vary.</p>
<p>One day Bob is importuned to give two feet off from
his library for a closet in the bedroom, but resists like a
Trojan. The next morning, being mollified by private
domestic supplications, Bob yields, and my wife rubs out
the lines of yesterday, two feet come off the library, and
a closet is constructed. But now the parlor proves too
narrow,&mdash;the parlor wall must be moved two feet into the
hall. Bob declares this will spoil the symmetry of the
latter; and, if there is anything he wants, it is a wide,
generous, ample hall to step into when you open the front
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says Marianne, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put two feet more
into the width of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t on account of the expense, you see,&rdquo; says Bob.
&ldquo;You see every additional foot of outside wall necessitates
so many more bricks, so much more flooring, so much more
roofing, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And my wife, with thoughtful brow, looks over the
plans, and considers how two feet more are to be got into
the parlor without moving any of the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; says Bob, bending over her shoulder, &ldquo;here,
take your two feet in the parlor, and put two more feet
on to the other side of the hall stairs;&rdquo; and he dashes
heavily with his pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob!&rdquo; exclaims Marianne, &ldquo;there are the kitchen
pantries! you ruin them,&mdash;and no place for the cellar
stairs!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the pantries and cellar stairs!&rdquo; says Bob.
&ldquo;Mother must find a place for them somewhere else. I
say the house must be roomy and cheerful, and pantries
and those things may take care of themselves; they can be
put <i>somewhere</i> well enough. No fear but you will find a
place for them somewhere. What do you women always
want such a great enormous kitchen for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not any larger than is necessary,&rdquo; said my wife,
thoughtfully; &ldquo;nothing is gained by taking off from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you should put it all down into a basement,&rdquo;
suggests Bob, &ldquo;and so get it all out of sight together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, if it can be helped,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;Basement
kitchens are necessary evils, only to be tolerated in cities
where land is too dear to afford any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So goes the discussion till the trio agree to sleep over it.
The next morning an inspiration visits my wife&rsquo;s pillow.
She is up and seizes plans and paper, and, before six o&rsquo;clock,
has enlarged the parlor very cleverly by throwing out a
bow-window. So waxes and wanes the prospective house,
innocently battered down and rebuilt with India-rubber and
black-lead. Doors are cut out to-night and walled up
to-morrow; windows knocked out here and put in there,
as some observer suggests possibilities of too much or too
little draught. Now all seems finished, when, lo! a discovery!
There is no fireplace nor stove-flue in my lady&rsquo;s
bedroom, and can be none without moving the bathing-room.
Pencil and India-rubber are busy again, and for
a while the whole house seems to threaten to fall to pieces
with the confusion of the moving; the bath-room wanders
like a ghost, now invading a closet, now threatening the
tranquillity of the parlor, till at last it is laid, by some
unheard-of calculations of my wife&rsquo;s, and sinks to rest in a
place so much better that everybody wonders it never was
thought of before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;it appears to me people don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
exactly know what they want when they build; why don&rsquo;t
you write a paper on housebuilding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of it,&rdquo; said I, with the air of a man
called to settle some great reform. &ldquo;It must be entirely
because Christopher has not written that our young people
and mamma are tangling themselves daily in webs which
are untangled the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;they have only just so much
money, and they want everything they can think of under
the sun. There&rsquo;s Bob been studying architectural antiquities,
and nobody knows what, and sketching all sorts of
curly-whorlies; and Marianne has her notions about a parlor
and boudoir and china closets and bedroom closets; and
Bob wants a baronial hall; and mamma stands out for
linen closets and bathing-rooms and all that; and so, among
them all it will just end in getting them head over ears in
debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing struck me as not improbable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Jenny, whether my writing an article is
going to prevent all this; but as my time in the &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo;
is coming round, I may as well write on what I am obliged
to think of, and so I will give a paper on the subject to
enliven our next evening&rsquo;s session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that evening, when Bob and Marianne had dropped in
as usual, and while the customary work of drawing and
rubbing out was going on at Mrs. Crowfield&rsquo;s sofa, I produced
my paper and read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>OUR HOUSE</h4>
<p>There is a place, called &ldquo;our house,&rdquo; which everybody
knows of. The sailor talks of it in his dreams at sea. The
wounded soldier, turning in his uneasy hospital-bed, brightens
at the word; it is like the dropping of cool water in
the desert, like the touch of cool fingers on a burning brow.
&ldquo;Our house,&rdquo; he says feebly, and the light comes back into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
his dim eyes; for all homely charities, all fond thoughts,
all purities, all that man loves on earth or hopes for in
heaven, rise with the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our house&rdquo; may be in any style of architecture, low
or high. It may be the brown old farmhouse, with its tall
wellsweep, or the one-story gambrel-roofed cottage, or the
large, square, white house, with green blinds, under the
wind-swung elms of a century; or it may be the log-cabin
of the wilderness, with its one room,&mdash;still there is a spell
in the memory of it beyond all conjurations. Its stone and
brick and mortar are like no other; its very clapboards and
shingles are dear to us, powerful to bring back the memories
of early days and all that is sacred in home love.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;Papa is getting quite sentimental,&rdquo; whispered Jenny,
loud enough for me to hear. I shook my head at her impressively,
and went on undaunted.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>There is no one fact of our human existence that has a
stronger influence upon us than the house we dwell in,
especially that in which our earlier and more impressible
years are spent. The building and arrangement of a house
influence the health, the comfort, the morals, the religion.
There have been houses built so devoid of all consideration
for the occupants, so rambling and haphazard in the disposal
of rooms, so sunless and cheerless and wholly without
snugness or privacy, as to make it seem impossible
to live a joyous, generous, rational, religious family life in
them.</p>
<p>There are, we shame to say, in our cities <i>things</i> called
houses, built and rented by people who walk erect and have
the general air and manner of civilized and Christianized
men, which are so inhuman in their building that they can
only be called snares and traps for souls,&mdash;places where
children cannot well escape growing up filthy and impure;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
places where to form a home is impossible, and to live a
decent, Christian life would require miraculous strength.</p>
<p>A celebrated British philanthropist, who had devoted
much study to the dwellings of the poor, gave it as his
opinion that the temperance societies were a hopeless undertaking
in London unless these dwellings underwent a transformation.
They were so squalid, so dark, so comfortless,
so constantly pressing upon the senses foulness, pain, and
inconvenience, that it was only by being drugged with gin
and opium that their miserable inhabitants could find heart
to drag on life from day to day. He had himself tried the
experiment of reforming a drunkard by taking him from
one of these loathsome dens, and enabling him to rent a
tenement in a block of model lodging-houses which had
been built under his supervision. The young man had
been a designer of figures for prints; he was of a delicate
frame, and a nervous, susceptible temperament. Shut in
one miserable room with his wife and little children, without
the possibility of pure air, with only filthy, fetid water to
drink, with the noise of other miserable families resounding
through the thin partitions, what possibility was there of
doing anything except by the help of stimulants, which for
a brief hour lifted him above the perception of these miseries?
Changed at once to a neat flat, where, for the same
rent as his former den, he had three good rooms, with water
for drinking, house-service, and bathing freely supplied,
and the blessed sunshine and air coming in through windows
well arranged for ventilation, he became in a few
weeks a new man. In the charms of the little spot which
he could call home, its quiet, its order, his former talent
came back to him, and he found strength, in pure air and
pure water and those purer thoughts of which they are the
emblems, to abandon burning and stupefying stimulants.</p>
<p>The influence of dwelling-houses for good or for evil&mdash;their
influence on the brain, the nerves, and, through these,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
on the heart and life&mdash;is one of those things that cannot be
enough pondered by those who build houses to sell or rent.</p>
<p>Something more generous ought to inspire a man than
merely the percentage which he can get for his money. He
who would build houses should think a little on the subject.
He should reflect what houses are for, what they may
be made to do for human beings. The great majority of
houses in cities are not built by the indwellers themselves;
they are built for them by those who invest their money
in this way, with little other thought than the percentage
which the investment will return.</p>
<p>For persons of ample fortune there are, indeed, palatial
residences, with all that wealth can do to render life delightful.
But in that class of houses which must be the
lot of the large majority, those which must be chosen by
young men in the beginning of life, when means are comparatively
restricted, there is yet wide room for thought and
the judicious application of money.</p>
<p>In looking over houses to be rented by persons of moderate
means, one cannot help longing to build,&mdash;one sees
so many ways in which the same sum which built an inconvenient
and unpleasant house might have been made to
build a delightful one.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; said Bob with emphasis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember,
Marianne, how many dismal, commonplace, shabby
houses we trailed through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marianne. &ldquo;You remember those houses
with such little squeezed rooms and that flourishing staircase,
with the colored-glass china-closet window, and no
butler&rsquo;s sink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;and those astonishing, abominable
stone abortions that adorned the doorsteps. People do lay
out a deal of money to make houses look ugly, it must be
confessed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;One would willingly,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;dispense with
frightful stone ornaments in front, and with heavy mouldings
inside, which are of no possible use or beauty, and with
showy plaster cornices and centrepieces in the parlor ceilings,
and even with marble mantels, for the luxury of hot
and cold water in each chamber, and a couple of comfortable
bath-rooms. Then, the disposition of windows and doors is
so wholly without regard to convenience! How often we
find rooms, meant for bedrooms, where really there is no
good place for either bed or dressing-table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here my wife looked up, having just finished redrawing
the plans to the latest alteration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the greatest reforms that could be, in these reforming
days,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;would be to have women
architects. The mischief with houses built to rent is that
they are all mere male contrivances. No woman would
ever plan chambers where there is no earthly place to set
a bed except against a window or door, or waste the room
in entries that might be made into closets. I don&rsquo;t see, for
my part, apropos to the modern movement for opening new
professions to the female sex, why there should not be well-educated
female architects. The planning and arrangement
of houses, and the laying-out of grounds, are a fair subject
of womanly knowledge and taste. It is the teaching of
Nature. What would anybody think of a bluebird&rsquo;s nest
that had been built entirely by Mr. Blue, without the help
of his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you must positively send a paper
on this subject to the next Woman&rsquo;s Rights Convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am of Sojourner Truth&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; said my wife,&mdash;&ldquo;that
the best way to prove the propriety of one&rsquo;s doing
anything is to go and <i>do it</i>. A woman who should have
energy to grow through the preparatory studies and set to
work in this field would, I am sure, soon find employment.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If she did as well as you would do, my dear,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;There are plenty of young women in our Boston high
schools who are going through higher fields of mathematics
than are required by the architect, and the schools for design
show the flexibility and fertility of the female pencil.
The thing appears to me altogether more feasible than many
other openings which have been suggested to woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t papa ever to go on with
his paper?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>I continued:&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>What ought &ldquo;our house&rdquo; to be? Could any other
question be asked admitting in its details of such varied
answers,&mdash;answers various as the means, the character,
and situation of different individuals? But there are great
wants, pertaining to every human being, into which all lesser
ones run. There are things in a house that every one, high
or low, rich or poor, ought, according to his means, to seek.
I think I shall class them according to the elemental division
of the old philosophers: Fire, Air, Earth, and Water.
These form the groundwork of this <i>need-be</i>,&mdash;the <i>sine-qua-nons</i>
of a house.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;Fire, air, earth, and water! I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said
Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little till you do, then,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I will try
to make my meaning plain.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>The first object of a house is shelter from the elements.
This object is effected by a tent or wigwam which keeps off
rain and wind. The first disadvantage of this shelter is,
that the vital air which you take into your lungs, and on
the purity of which depends the purity of blood and brain
and nerves, is vitiated. In the wigwam or tent you are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
constantly taking in poison, more or less active, with every
inspiration. Napoleon had his army sleep without tents.
He stated that from experience he found it more healthy,
and wonderful have been the instances of delicate persons
gaining constantly in rigor from being obliged, in the midst
of hardships, to sleep constantly in the open air. Now the
first problem in housebuilding is to combine the advantage
of shelter with the fresh elasticity of outdoor air. I am
not going to give here a treatise on ventilation, but merely
to say, in general terms, that the first object of a house
builder or contriver should be to make a healthy house; and
the first requisite of a healthy house is a pure, sweet, elastic
air.</p>
<p>I am in favor, therefore, of those plans of housebuilding
which have wide central spaces, whether halls or courts,
into which all the rooms open, and which necessarily preserve
a body of fresh air for the use of them all. In hot
climates this is the object of the central court which cuts
into the body of the house, with its fountain and flowers,
and its galleries, into which the various apartments open.
When people are restricted for space, and cannot afford to
give up wide central portions of the house for the mere
purposes of passage, this central hall can be made a pleasant
sitting-room. With tables, chairs, bookcases, and sofas
comfortably disposed, this ample central room above and
below is, in many respects, the most agreeable lounging room
of the house; while the parlors below and the chambers
above, opening upon it, form agreeable withdrawing rooms
for purposes of greater privacy.</p>
<p>It is customary with many persons to sleep with bedroom
windows open,&mdash;a very imperfect and often dangerous
mode of procuring that supply of fresh air which a sleeping-room
requires. In a house constructed in the manner indicated,
windows might be freely left open in these central
halls, producing there a constant movement of air, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
doors of the bedrooms placed ajar, when a very slight
opening in the windows would create a free circulation
through the apartments.</p>
<p>In the planning of a house, thought should be had as to
the general disposition of the windows, and the quarters
from which favoring breezes may be expected should be
carefully considered. Windows should be so arranged that
draughts of air can be thrown quite through and across the
house. How often have we seen pale mothers and drooping
babes fanning and panting during some of our hot days on
the sunny side of a house, while the breeze that should
have cooled them beat in vain against a dead wall! One
longs sometimes to knock holes through partitions, and let
in the air of heaven.</p>
<p>No other gift of God so precious, so inspiring, is treated
with such utter irreverence and contempt in the calculations
of us mortals as this same air of heaven. A sermon on
oxygen, if one had a preacher who understood the subject,
might do more to repress sin than the most orthodox discourse
to show when and how and why sin came. A minister
gets up in a crowded lecture-room, where the mephitic
air almost makes the candles burn blue, and bewails the
deadness of the church,&mdash;the church the while, drugged
by the poisoned air, growing sleepier and sleepier, though
they feel dreadfully wicked for being so.</p>
<p>Little Jim, who, fresh from his afternoon&rsquo;s ramble in
the fields, last evening said his prayers dutifully, and lay
down to sleep in a most Christian frame, this morning sits
up in bed with his hair bristling with crossness, strikes at
his nurse, and declares he won&rsquo;t say his prayers,&mdash;that he
don&rsquo;t want to be good. The simple difference is, that the
child, having slept in a close box of a room, his brain all
night fed by poison, is in a mild state of moral insanity.
Delicate women remark that it takes them till eleven or
twelve o&rsquo;clock to get up their strength in the morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Query: Do they sleep with closed windows and doors, and
with heavy bed-curtains?</p>
<p>The houses built by our ancestors were better ventilated
in certain respects than modern ones, with all their improvements.
The great central chimney, with its open fireplaces
in the different rooms, created a constant current which carried
off foul and vitiated air. In these days, how common
is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove! This
flue is kept shut in summer, and in winter opened only to
admit a close stove, which burns away the vital portion of
the air quite as fast as the occupants breathe it away. The
sealing up of fireplaces and introduction of air-tight stoves
may, doubtless, be a saving of fuel; it saves, too, more than
that,&mdash;in thousands and thousands of cases it has saved
people from all further human wants, and put an end forever
to any needs short of the six feet of narrow earth which
are man&rsquo;s only inalienable property. In other words, since
the invention of air-tight stoves, thousands have died of slow
poison. It is a terrible thing to reflect upon, that our Northern
winters last from November to May, six long months,
in which many families confine themselves to one room,
of which every window-crack has been carefully calked to
make it air-tight, where an air-tight stove keeps the atmosphere
at a temperature between eighty and ninety, and the
inmates sitting there, with all their winter clothes on, become
enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air, for
which there is no escape but the occasional opening of a door.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the first result of all this is such a
delicacy of skin and lungs that about half the inmates are
obliged to give up going into the open air during the six
cold months, because they invariably catch cold if they do
so. It is no wonder that the cold caught about the first of
December has by the first of March become a fixed consumption,
and that the opening of the spring, which ought
to bring life and health, in so many cases brings death.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>We hear of the lean condition in which the poor bears
emerge from their six months&rsquo; wintering, during which they
subsist on the fat which they have acquired the previous
summer. Even so, in our long winters, multitudes of delicate
people subsist on the daily waning strength which they
acquired in the season when windows and doors were open,
and fresh air was a constant luxury. No wonder we hear
of spring fever and spring biliousness, and have thousands
of nostrums for clearing the blood in the spring. All these
things are the pantings and palpitations of a system run
down under slow poison, unable to get a step farther.
Better, far better, the old houses of the olden time, with
their great roaring fires, and their bedrooms where the snow
came in and the wintry winds whistled. Then, to be sure,
you froze your back while you burned your face; your water
froze nightly in your pitcher; your breath congealed in ice-wreaths
on the blankets; and you could write your name
on the pretty snow-wreath that had sifted in through the
window-cracks. But you woke full of life and vigor,&mdash;you
looked out into the whirling snowstorms without a
shiver, and thought nothing of plunging through drifts as
high as your head on your daily way to school. You jingled
in sleighs, you snowballed, you lived in snow like a
snowbird, and your blood coursed and tingled, in full tide
of good, merry, real life, through your veins,&mdash;none of the
slow-creeping, black blood which clogs the brain and lies
like a weight on the vital wheels!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us, papa!&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I hope we need
not go back to such houses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I only said that such
houses were better than those which are all winter closed
by double windows and burnt-out air-tight stoves.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>The perfect house is one in which there is a constant
escape of every foul and vitiated particle of air through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
one opening, while a constant supply of fresh outdoor air
is admitted by another. In winter, this outdoor air must
pass through some process by which it is brought up to a
temperate warmth.</p>
<p>Take a single room, and suppose on one side a current
of outdoor air which has been warmed by passing through
the air chamber of a modern furnace. Its temperature need
not be above sixty-five,&mdash;it answers breathing purposes
better at that. On the other side of the room let there be
an open wood or coal fire. One cannot conceive the purposes
of warmth and ventilation more perfectly combined.</p>
<p>Suppose a house with a great central hall, into which
a current of fresh, temperately warmed air is continually
pouring. Each chamber opening upon this hall has a
chimney up whose flue the rarefied air is constantly passing,
drawing up with it all the foul and poisonous gases.
That house is well ventilated, and in a way that need bring
no dangerous draughts upon the most delicate invalid. For
the better securing of privacy in sleeping-rooms, we have
seen two doors employed, one of which is made with slats,
like a window-blind, so that air is freely transmitted without
exposing the interior.</p>
<p>When we speak of fresh air, we insist on the full rigor
of the term. It must not be the air of a cellar, heavily
laden with the poisonous nitrogen of turnips and cabbages,
but good, fresh, outdoor air from a cold-air pipe, so placed
as not to get the lower stratum near the ground, where
heavy damps and exhalations collect, but high up, in just
the clearest and most elastic region.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the whole matter is, that as all of
man&rsquo;s and woman&rsquo;s peace and comfort, all their love, all
their amiability, all their religion, have got to come to
them, while they live in this world, through the medium
of the brain,&mdash;and as black, uncleansed blood acts on the
brain as a poison, and as no other than black, uncleansed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
blood can be got by the lungs out of impure air,&mdash;the first
object of the man who builds a house is to secure a pure
and healthy atmosphere therein.</p>
<p>Therefore, in allotting expenses, set this down as a
<i>must-be</i>: &ldquo;Our house must have fresh air,&mdash;everywhere,
at all times, winter and summer.&rdquo; Whether we have
stone facings or no; whether our parlor has cornices or
marble mantles or no; whether our doors are machine-made
or hand-made. All our fixtures shall be of the
plainest and simplest, but we will have fresh air. We
will open our door with a latch and string, if we cannot
afford lock and knob and fresh air too; but in our house
we will live cleanly and Christianly. We will no more
breathe the foul air rejected from a neighbor&rsquo;s lungs than
we will use a neighbor&rsquo;s tooth-brush and hair-brush. Such
is the first essential of &ldquo;our house,&rdquo;&mdash;the first great element
of human health and happiness,&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Air</span>.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;I say, Marianne,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;have we got fireplaces
in our chambers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma took care of that,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be quite sure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if your mother has
had a hand in planning your house, that the ventilation is
cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Bob&rsquo;s principal idea in a house
had been a Gothic library, and his mind had labored more
on the possibility of adapting some favorite bits from the
baronial antiquities to modern needs than on anything so
terrestrial as air. Therefore he awoke as from a dream,
and taking two or three monstrous inhalations, he seized
the plans and began looking over them with new energy.
Meanwhile I went on with my prelection.</p>
<p>The second great vital element for which provision must
be made in &ldquo;our house&rdquo; is <span class='smcap'>Fire</span>. By which I do not mean
merely artificial fire, but fire in all its extent and branches,&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
heavenly fire which God sends us daily on the bright
wings of sunbeams, as well as the mimic fires by which we
warm our dwellings, cook our food, and light our nightly
darkness.</p>
<p>To begin, then, with heavenly fire or sunshine. If God&rsquo;s
gift of vital air is neglected and undervalued, His gift of
sunshine appears to be hated. There are many houses
where not a cent has been expended on ventilation, but
where hundreds of dollars have been freely lavished to keep
out the sunshine. The chamber, truly, is tight as a box;
it has no fireplace, not even a ventilator opening into the
stove-flue; but, oh, joy and gladness! it has outside blinds
and inside folding-shutters, so that in the brightest of days we
may create there a darkness that may be felt. To observe
the generality of New England houses, a spectator might imagine
they were planned for the torrid zone, where the great
object is to keep out a furnace draught of burning air.</p>
<p>But let us look over the months of our calendar. In
which of them do we not need fires on our hearths? We
will venture to say that from October to June all families,
whether they actually have it or not, would be the more
comfortable for a morning and evening fire. For eight
months in the year the weather varies on the scale of cool,
cold, colder, and freezing; and for all the four other months
what is the number of days that really require the torrid-zone
system of shutting up houses? We all know that extreme
heat is the exception, and not the rule.</p>
<p>Yet let anybody travel, as I did last year, through the
valley of the Connecticut, and observe the houses. All
clean and white and neat and well-to-do, with their turfy
yards and their breezy great elms, but all shut up from
basement to attic, as if the inmates had all sold out and
gone to China. Not a window-blind open above or below.
Is the house inhabited? No,&mdash;yes,&mdash;there is a faint
stream of blue smoke from the kitchen chimney, and half a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
window-blind open in some distant back part of the house.
They are living there in the dim shadows, bleaching like
potato-sprouts in the cellar.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you why they do it, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the flies, and flies are certainly worthy to be one of
the plagues of Egypt. I can&rsquo;t myself blame people that
shut up their rooms and darken their houses in fly-time,&mdash;do
you, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in extreme cases; though I think there is but a
short season when this is necessary; yet the habit of shutting
up lasts the year round, and gives to New England
villages that dead, silent, cold, uninhabited look which is
so peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one fact that a traveler would gather in passing
through our villages would be this,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the people
live in their houses and in the dark. Barely do you
see doors and windows open, people sitting at them, chairs
in the yard, and signs that the inhabitants are living out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I have told you why, for I have
been at Uncle Peter&rsquo;s in summer, and aunt does her spring-cleaning
in May, and then she shuts all the blinds and
drops all the curtains, and the house stays clean till October.
That&rsquo;s the whole of it. If she had all her windows
open, there would be paint and windows to be cleaned
every week; and who is to do it? For my part, I can&rsquo;t
much blame her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have my doubts about the sovereign
efficacy of living in the dark, even if the great object of existence
were to be rid of flies. I remember, during this
same journey, stopping for a day or two at a country boarding-house,
which was dark as Egypt from cellar to garret.
The long, dim, gloomy dining-room was first closed by outside
blinds, and then by impenetrable paper curtains, notwithstanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
which it swarmed and buzzed like a beehive.
You found where the cake plate was by the buzz which
your hand made, if you chanced to reach in that direction.
It was disagreeable, because in the darkness flies could not
always be distinguished from huckleberries; and I couldn&rsquo;t
help wishing, that, since we must have the flies, we might
at last have the light and air to console us under them.
People darken their rooms and shut up every avenue of outdoor
enjoyment, and sit and think of nothing but flies; in
fact, flies are all they have left. No wonder they become
morbid on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, papa talks just like a man, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said
Jenny. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the responsibility of keeping things
clean. I wonder what he would do, if he were a housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do? I will tell you. I would do the best I could.
I would shut my eyes on fly-specks, and open them on the
beauties of Nature. I would let the cheerful sun in all day
long, in all but the few summer days when coolness is the
one thing needful: those days may be soon numbered every
year. I would make a calculation in the spring how
much it would cost to hire a woman to keep my windows
and paint clean, and I would do with one less gown and
have her; and when I had spent all I could afford on
cleaning windows and paint, I would harden my heart and
turn off my eyes, and enjoy my sunshine and my fresh air,
my breezes, and all that can be seen through the picture
windows of an open, airy house, and snap my fingers at the
flies. There you have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s hobby is sunshine,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? Was God mistaken, when He
made the sun? Did He make him for us to hold a life&rsquo;s
battle with? Is that vital power which reddens the cheek
of the peach and pours sweetness through the fruits and
flowers of no use to us? Look at plants that grow without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
sun,&mdash;wan, pale, long-visaged, holding feeble, imploring
hands of supplication towards the light. Can human
beings afford to throw away a vitalizing force so pungent,
so exhilarating? You remember the experiment of a prison
where one row of cells had daily sunshine and the others
none. With the same regimen, the same cleanliness, the
same care, the inmates of the sunless cells were visited with
sickness and death in double measure. Our whole population
in New England are groaning and suffering under afflictions,
the result of a depressed vitality,&mdash;neuralgia, with a
new ache for every day of the year, rheumatism, consumption,
general debility; for all these a thousand nostrums
are daily advertised, and money enough is spent on them to
equip an army, while we are fighting against, wasting, and
throwing away with both hands, that blessed influence which
comes nearest to pure vitality of anything God has given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it that the Bible describes as a sun, arising
with healing in his wings? Surely, that sunshine which
is the chosen type and image of His love must be healing
through all the recesses of our daily life, drying damp and
mould, defending from moth and rust, sweetening ill smells,
clearing from the nerves the vapors of melancholy, making
life cheery. If I did not know Him, I should certainly
adore and worship the sun, the most blessed and beautiful
image of Him among things visible! In the land of Egypt,
in the day of God&rsquo;s wrath, there was darkness, but in the
land of Goshen there was light. I am a Goshenite, and
mean to walk in the light, and forswear the works of darkness.
But to proceed with our reading.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;Our house&rdquo; shall be set on a southeast line, so that
there shall not be a sunless room in it, and windows shall
be so arranged that it can be traversed and transpierced
through and through with those bright shafts of light which
come straight from God.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Our house&rdquo; shall not be blockaded with a dank, dripping
mass of shrubbery set plumb against the windows,
keeping out light and air. There shall be room all round
it for breezes to sweep, and sunshine to sweeten and dry
and vivify; and I would warn all good souls who begin life
by setting out two little evergreen-trees within a foot of
each of their front-windows, that these trees will grow and
increase till their front-rooms will be brooded over by a
sombre, stifling shadow fit only for ravens to croak in.</p>
<p>One would think, by the way some people hasten to convert
a very narrow front-yard into a dismal jungle, that the
only danger of our New England climate was sunstroke.
Ah, in those drizzling months which form at least one half
of our life here, what sullen, censorious, uncomfortable, unhealthy
thoughts are bred of living in dark, chilly rooms,
behind such dripping thickets? Our neighbors&rsquo; faults assume
a deeper hue, life seems a dismal thing, our very religion
grows mouldy.</p>
<p>My idea of a house is, that, as far as is consistent with
shelter and reasonable privacy, it should give you on first
entering an open, breezy, outdoor freshness of sensation.
Every window should be a picture&mdash;sun and trees and
clouds and green grass should seem never to be far from us.
&ldquo;Our house&rdquo; may shade but not darken us. &ldquo;Our house&rdquo;
shall have bow-windows, many, sunny, and airy,&mdash;not for
the purpose of being cleaned and shut up, but to be open
and enjoyed. There shall be long verandas above and below,
where invalids may walk dry-shod, and enjoy open-air
recreation in wettest weather. In short, I will try to have
&ldquo;our house&rdquo; combine as far as possible the sunny, joyous,
fresh life of a gypsy in the fields and woods with the quiet
and neatness and comfort and shelter of a roof, rooms, floors,
and carpets.</p>
<p>After heavenly fire, I have a word to say of earthly,
artificial fires. Furnaces, whether of hot water, steam, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
hot air, are all healthy and admirable provisions for warming
our houses during the eight or nine months of our year
that we must have artificial heat, if only, as I have said,
fireplaces keep up a current of ventilation.</p>
<p>The kitchen-range with its water-back I humbly salute.
It is a great throbbing heart, and sends its warm tides of
cleansing, comforting fluid all through the house. One
could wish that this friendly dragon could be in some way
moderated in his appetite for coal,&mdash;he does consume without
mercy, it must be confessed,&mdash;but then great is the
work he has to do. At any hour of day or night, in the
most distant part of your house, you have but to turn a
stop-cock and your red dragon sends you hot water for your
need; your washing-day becomes a mere play-day; your
pantry has its ever-ready supply; and then, by a little judicious
care in arranging apartments and economizing heat, a
range may make two or three chambers comfortable in winter
weather. A range with a water-back is among the <i>must-be&rsquo;s</i>
in &ldquo;our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as to the evening light,&mdash;I know nothing as yet
better than gas, where it can be had. I would certainly
not have a house without it. The great objection to it is
the danger of its escape through imperfect fixtures. But it
must not do this: a fluid that kills a tree or a plant with
one breath must certainly be a dangerous ingredient in the
atmosphere, and if admitted into houses, must be introduced
with every safeguard.</p>
<p>There are families living in the country who make their
own gas by a very simple process. This is worth an inquiry
from those who build. There are also contrivances now
advertised, with good testimonials, of domestic machines
for generating gas, said to be perfectly safe, simple to be
managed, and producing a light superior to that of the city
gas works. This also is worth an inquiry when &ldquo;our
house&rdquo; is to be in the country.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>And now I come to the next great vital element for which
&ldquo;our house&rdquo; must provide,&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Water</span>. &ldquo;Water, water,
everywhere,&rdquo;&mdash;it must be plentiful, it must be easy to get
at, it must be pure. Our ancestors had some excellent ideas
in home living and housebuilding. Their houses were,
generally speaking, very sensibly contrived,&mdash;roomy, airy,
and comfortable; but in their water arrangements they had
little mercy on womankind. The well was out in the yard;
and in winter one must flounder through snow and bring up
the ice-bound bucket, before one could fill the tea-kettle for
breakfast. For a sovereign princess of the republic, this
was hardly respectful or respectable. Wells have come somewhat
nearer in modern times; but the idea of a constant
supply of fresh water by the simple turning of a stop-cock
has not yet visited the great body of our houses. Were we
free to build &ldquo;our house&rdquo; just as we wish it, there should
be a bath-room to every two or three inmates, and the hot
and cold water should circulate to every chamber.</p>
<p>Among our <i>must-be&rsquo;s</i>, we would lay by a generous sum
for plumbing. Let us have our bath-rooms, and our arrangements
for cleanliness and health in kitchen and pantry;
and afterwards let the quality of our lumber and the style
of our finishing be according to the sum we have left. The
power to command a warm bath in a house at any hour of
day or night is better in bringing up a family of children
than any amount of ready medicine. In three quarters of
childish ailments the warm bath is an almost immediate
remedy. Bad colds, incipient fevers, rheumatisms, convulsions,
neuralgias innumerable, are washed off in their first
beginnings, and run down the lead pipes into oblivion.
Have, then, O friend, all the water in your house that you
can afford, and enlarge your ideas of the worth of it, that you
<i>may</i> afford a great deal. A bathing-room is nothing to you
that requires an hour of lifting and fire-making to prepare
it for use. The apparatus is too cumbrous,&mdash;you do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
turn to it. But when your chamber opens upon a neat,
quiet little nook, and you have only to turn your stop-cocks
and all is ready, your remedy is at hand, you use it constantly.
You are waked in the night by a scream, and find
little Tom sitting up, wild with burning fever. In three
minutes he is in the bath, quieted and comfortable; you get
him back, cooled and tranquil, to his little crib, and in the
morning he wakes as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Why should not so invaluable and simple a remedy for
disease, such a preservative of health, such a comfort, such
a stimulus, be considered as much a matter-of-course in a
house as a kitchen-chimney? At least there should be one
bath-room always in order, so arranged that all the family
can have access to it, if one cannot afford the luxury of
many.</p>
<p>A house in which water is universally and skillfully distributed
is so much easier to take care of as almost to verify
the saying of a friend, that his house was so contrived that
it did its own work: one had better do without carpets on
the floors, without stuffed sofas and rocking-chairs, and secure
this.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;you have made out all
your four elements in your house, except one. I can&rsquo;t imagine
what you want of <i>earth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;that the less of our common
mother we had in our houses, the better housekeepers we
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we philosophers must give an
occasional dip into the mystical, and say something apparently
absurd for the purpose of explaining that we mean
nothing in particular by it. It gives common people an
idea of our sagacity, to find how clear we come out of our
apparent contradictions and absurdities. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>For the fourth requisite of "our house," <span class='smcap'>Earth</span>, let me
point you to your mother&rsquo;s plant-window, and beg you to
remember the fact that through our long, dreary winters we
are never a month without flowers, and the vivid interest
which always attaches to growing things. The perfect
house, as I conceive it, is to combine as many of the advantages
of living out of doors as may be consistent with
warmth and shelter, and one of these is the sympathy with
green and growing things. Plants are nearer in their relations
to human health and vigor than is often imagined.
The cheerfulness that well-kept plants impart to a room
comes not merely from gratification of the eye,&mdash;there is a
healthful exhalation from them, they are a corrective of the
impurities of the atmosphere. Plants, too, are valuable as
tests of the vitality of the atmosphere; their drooping and
failure convey to us information that something is amiss
with it. A lady once told me that she could never raise
plants in her parlors on account of the gas and anthracite
coal. I answered, &ldquo;Are you not afraid to live and bring
up your children in an atmosphere which blights your
plants?&rdquo; If the gas escape from the pipes, and the red-hot
anthracite coal or the red-hot air-tight stove burns out
all the vital part of the air, so that healthy plants in a few
days wither and begin to drop their leaves, it is sign that the
air must be looked to and reformed. It is a fatal augury
for a room that plants cannot be made to thrive in it.
Plants should not turn pale, be long-jointed, long-leaved,
and spindling; and where they grow in this way, we may
be certain that there is a want of vitality for human beings.
But where plants appear as they do in the open air, with vigorous,
stocky growth, and short-stemmed, deep-green leaves,
we may believe the conditions of that atmosphere are
healthy for human lungs.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to see how the custom of plant growing has
spread through our country. In how many farmhouse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
windows do we see petunias and nasturtiums vivid with
bloom, while snows are whirling without, and how much
brightness have those cheap enjoyments shed on the lives
of those who cared for them! We do not believe there is
a human being who would not become a passionate lover of
plants, if circumstances once made it imperative to tend
upon and watch the growth of one. The history of Picciola
for substance has been lived over and over by many a man
and woman who once did not know that there was a particle
of plant-love in their souls. But to the proper care of
plants in pots there are many hindrances and drawbacks.
The dust chokes the little pores of their green lungs, and
they require constant showering; and to carry all one&rsquo;s
plants to a sink or porch for this purpose is a labor which
many will not endure. Consequently plants often do not
get a showering once a month! We should try to imitate
more closely the action of Mother Nature, who washes every
green child of hers nightly with dews, which lie glittering
on its leaves till morning.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there it is!&rdquo; said Jenny. &ldquo;I think I could
manage with plants, if it were not for this eternal showering
and washing they seem to require to keep them fresh.
They are always tempting one to spatter the carpet and
surrounding furniture, which are not equally benefited by
the libation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is partly for that very reason,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the
plan of &lsquo;our house&rsquo; provides for the introduction of Mother
Earth, as you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>A perfect house, according to my idea, should always include
in it a little compartment where plants can be kept,
can be watered, can be defended from the dust, and have
the sunshine and all the conditions of growth.</p>
<p>People have generally supposed a conservatory to be one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
of the last trappings of wealth,&mdash;something not to be
thought of for those in modest circumstances. But is this
so? You have a bow-window in your parlor. Leave out
the flooring, fill the space with rich earth, close it from the
parlor by glass doors, and you have room for enough plants
and flowers to keep you gay and happy all winter. If on
the south side, where the sunbeams have power, it requires
no heat but that which warms the parlor; and the comfort
of it is incalculable, and the expense a mere trifle greater
than that of the bow-window alone.</p>
<p>In larger houses a larger space might be appropriated in
this way. We will not call it a conservatory, because that
name suggests ideas of gardeners, and mysteries of culture
and rare plants, which bring all sorts of care and expense
in their train. We would rather call it a greenery, a room
floored with earth, with glass sides to admit the sun,&mdash;and
let it open on as many other rooms of the house as possible.</p>
<p>Why should not the dining-room and parlor be all winter
connected by a spot of green and flowers, with plants,
mosses, and ferns for the shadowy portions, and such simple
blooms as petunias and nasturtiums garlanding the sunny
portion near the windows? If near the water-works, this
greenery might be enlivened by the play of a fountain, whose
constant spray would give that softness to the air which is
so often burned away by the dry heat of the furnace.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>&ldquo;And do you really think, papa, that houses built in
this way are a practical result to be aimed at?&rdquo; said Jenny.
&ldquo;To me it seems like a dream of the Alhambra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I happen to have seen real people in our day living
in just such a house,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I could point you, this
very hour, to a cottage, which in style of building is the
plainest possible, which unites many of the best ideas of a
true house. My dear, can you sketch the ground plan of
that house we saw in Brighton?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said my wife, after a few dashes with her
pencil, &ldquo;an inexpensive house, yet one of the pleasantest I
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:300px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/230.png' alt='House Blueprint' title='c, China-closet. p, Passage. d, Kitchen-closet.' width='300' height='191' /><br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&ldquo;This cottage, which might,</span> at the rate of prices before
the war, have been built for five thousand dollars, has many
of the requirements which I seek for a house. It has two
stories, and a tier of very pleasant attic-rooms, two bathing-rooms,
and the water carried into each story. The parlor
and dining-room both look into a little bower, where a fountain
is ever playing into a little marble basin, and which all
the year through has its green and bloom. It is heated simply
from the furnace by a register, like any other room of
the house, and requires no more care than a delicate woman
could easily give. The brightness and cheerfulness it brings
during our long, dreary winters is incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>But one caution is necessary in all such appendages. The
earth must be thoroughly underdrained to prevent the vapors
of stagnant water, and have a large admixture of broken
charcoal to obviate the consequences of vegetable decomposition.
Great care must be taken that there be no leaves
left to fall and decay on the ground, since vegetable exhalations
poison the air. With these precautions such a plot
will soften and purify the air of a house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>Where the means do not allow even so small a conservatory,
a recessed window might be fitted with a deep box,
which should have a drain-pipe at the bottom, and a thick
layer of broken charcoal and gravel, with a mixture of fine
wood-soil and sand, for the top stratum. Here ivies may be
planted, which will run and twine and strike their little tendrils
here and there, and give the room in time the aspect of a
bower; the various greenhouse nasturtiums will make winter
gorgeous with blossoms. In windows unblessed by sunshine&mdash;and,
alas! such are many&mdash;one can cultivate ferns and
mosses; the winter-growing ferns, of which there are many
varieties, can be mixed with mosses and woodland flowers.</p>
<p>Early in February, when the cheerless frosts of winter
seem most wearisome, the common blue violet, wood anemone,
hepatica, or rock-columbine, if planted in this way, will
begin to bloom. The common partridge-berry, with its brilliant
scarlet fruit and dark-green leaves, will also grow finely
in such situations, and have a beautiful effect. These things
require daily showering to keep them fresh, and the moisture
arising from them will soften and freshen the too dry air of
heated winter rooms.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>Thus I have been through my four essential elements in
housebuilding,&mdash;air, fire, water, and earth. I would provide
for these before anything else. After they are secured,
I would gratify my taste and fancy as far as possible in other
ways. I quite agree with Bob in hating commonplace houses,
and longing for some little bit of architectural effect! and I
grieve profoundly that every step in that direction must
cost so much. I have also a taste for niceness of finish.
I have no objection to silver-plated door-locks and hinges,
none to windows which are an entire plate of clear glass.
I congratulate neighbors who are so fortunate as to be able
to get them; and after I have put all the essentials into a
house, I would have these too, if I had the means.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>But if all my wood work were to be without groove or
moulding, if my mantels were to be of simple wood, if my
doors were all to be machine-made, and my lumber of the
second quality, I would have my bath-rooms, my conservatory,
my sunny bow-windows, and my perfect ventilation;
and my house would then be so pleasant, and every one in
it in such a cheerful mood, that it would verily seem to be
ceiled with cedar.</p>
<p>Speaking of ceiling with cedar, I have one thing more to
say. We Americans have a country abounding in beautiful
timber, of whose beauties we know nothing, on account of
the pernicious and stupid habit of covering it with white
paint.</p>
<p>The celebrated zebra wood with its golden stripes cannot
exceed in quaint beauty the grain of unpainted chestnut,
prepared simply with a coat or two of oil. The butternut
has a rich golden brown, the very darling color of painters,
a shade so rich, and grain so beautiful, that it is of itself as
charming to look at as a rich picture. The black-walnut,
with its heavy depth of tone, works in well as an adjunct;
and as to oak, what can we say enough of its quaint and
many shadings? Even common pine, which has been considered
not decent to look upon till hastily shrouded in a
friendly blanket of white paint, has, when oiled and varnished,
the beauty of satin-wood. The second quality of
pine, which has what are called <i>shakes</i> in it, under this
mode of treatment often shows clouds and veins equal in
beauty to the choicest woods. The cost of such a finish is
greatly less than that of the old method; and it saves those
days and weeks of cleaning which are demanded by white
paint, while its general tone is softer and more harmonious.
Experiments in color may be tried in the combinations of
these woods, which at small expense produce the most charming
effects.</p>
<p>As to paper hangings, we are proud to say that our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
American manufacturers now furnish all that can be desired.
There are some branches of design where artistic, ingenious
France must still excel us; but whoso has a house to fit up,
let him first look at what his own country has to show, and
he will be astonished.</p>
<p>There is one topic in housebuilding on which I would
add a few words. The difficulty of procuring and keeping
good servants, which must long be one of our chief domestic
troubles, warns us so to arrange our houses that we shall
need as few as possible. There is the greatest conceivable
difference in the planning and building of houses as to the
amount of work which will be necessary to keep them in
respectable condition. Some houses require a perfect staff
of housemaids: there are plated hinges to be rubbed, paint
to be cleaned, with intricacies of moulding and carving
which daily consume hours of dusting to preserve them
from a slovenly look. Simple finish, unpainted wood, a
general distribution of water through the dwelling, will
enable a very large house to be cared for by one pair of
hands, and yet maintain a creditable appearance.</p>
<p>In kitchens one servant may perform the work of two by
a close packing of all the conveniences for cooking and such
arrangements as shall save time and steps. Washing-day
may be divested of its terrors by suitable provisions for
water, hot and cold; by wringers, which save at once the
strength of the linen and of the laundress; and by drying-closets
connected with ranges, where articles can in a few
moments be perfectly dried. These, with the use of a small
mangle, such as is now common in America, reduce the
labors of the laundry one half.</p>
<p>There are many more things which might be said of &ldquo;our
house,&rdquo; and Christopher may, perhaps, find some other
opportunity to say them. For the present his pen is tired
and ceaseth.</p>

<h3>XII <br /><br />HOME RELIGION</h3>
</div>
<p>It was Sunday evening, and our little circle were convened
by my study fireside, where a crackling hickory fire
proclaimed the fall of the year to be coming on, and cold
weather impending. Sunday evenings, my married boys
and girls are fond of coming home and gathering round the
old hearthstone, and &ldquo;making believe&rdquo; that they are
children again. We get out the old-fashioned music-books,
and sing old hymns to very old tunes, and my wife and her
matron daughters talk about the babies in the intervals;
and we discourse of the sermon, and of the choir, and all
the general outworks of good pious things which Sunday
suggests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;you are closing up your &lsquo;House
and Home Papers,&rsquo; are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I am come to the last one, for this year at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;there is one subject you
haven&rsquo;t touched on yet; you ought not to close the year
without it; no house and home can be complete without
Religion: you should write a paper on Home Religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife, as you may have seen in these papers, is an
old-fashioned woman, something of a conservative. I am,
I confess, rather given to progress and speculation; but I
feel always as if I were going on in these ways with a
string round my waist, and my wife&rsquo;s hand steadily pulling
me back into the old paths. My wife is a steady, Bible-reading,
Sabbath-keeping woman, cherishing the memory of
her fathers, and loving to do as they did,&mdash;believing, for
the most part, that the paths well beaten by righteous feet
are safest, even though much walking therein has worn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
away the grass and flowers. Nevertheless, she has an
indulgent ear for all that gives promise of bettering anybody
or anything, and therefore is not severe on any new
methods that may arise in our progressive days of accomplishing
old good objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a home religion,&rdquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in home religion,&rdquo; said Bob Stephens,&mdash;&ldquo;but
not in the outward show of it. The best sort of religion
is that which one keeps at the bottom of his heart,
and which goes up thence quietly through all his actions,
and not the kind that comes through a certain routine of
forms and ceremonies. Do you suppose family prayers,
now, and a blessing at meals, make people any better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, Robert,&rdquo; said my wife,&mdash;she always
calls him Robert on Sunday evenings,&mdash;&ldquo;depend upon it,
we are not so very much wiser than our fathers were, that
we need depart from their good old ways. Of course I
would have religion in the heart, and spreading quietly
through the life; but does this interfere with those outward,
daily acts of respect and duty which we owe to our
Creator? It is too much the slang of our day to decry
forms, and to exalt the excellency of the spirit in opposition
to them; but tell me, are you satisfied with friendship that
has none of the outward forms of friendship, or love that
has none of the outward forms of love? Are you satisfied
of the existence of a sentiment that has no outward mode of
expression? Even the old heathen had their pieties; they
would not begin a feast without a libation to their divinities,
and there was a shrine in every well-regulated house for
household gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with all these things,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;is that
they get to be mere forms. I never could see that family
worship amounted to much more in most families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outward expression of all good things is apt to
degenerate into mere form,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The outward expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
of social good feeling becomes a mere form; but for
that reason must we meet each other like oxen? not say,
&lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Good evening,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I am happy to see
you&rsquo;? Must we never use any of the forms of mutual
good will, except in those moments when we are excited by
a real, present emotion? What would become of society?
Forms are, so to speak, a daguerreotype of a past good feeling,
meant to take and keep the impression of it when it is
gone. Our best and most inspired moments are crystallized
in them; and even when the spirit that created them is
gone, they help to bring it back. Every one must be conscious
that the use of the forms of social benevolence, even
towards those who are personally unpleasant to us, tends
to ameliorate prejudices. We see a man entering our door
who is a weary bore, but we use with him those forms of
civility which society prescribes, and feel far kinder to
him than if we had shut the door in his face and said,
&lsquo;Go along, you tiresome fellow!&rsquo; Now why does not this
very obvious philosophy apply to better and higher feelings?
The forms of religion are as much more necessary than the
forms of politeness and social good will as religion is more
important than all other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;a form of worship kept up
from year to year in a family&mdash;the assembling of parents
and children for a few sacred moments each day, though
it may be a form many times, especially in the gay and
thoughtless hours of life&mdash;often becomes invested with
deep sacredness in times of trouble, or in those crises that
rouse our deeper feelings. In sickness, in bereavement, in
separation, the daily prayer at home has a sacred and healing
power. Then we remember the scattered and wandering
ones; and the scattered and wandering think tenderly
of that hour when they know they are remembered. I
know, when I was a young girl, I was often thoughtless
and careless about family prayers; but now that my father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
and mother are gone forever, there is nothing I recall more
often. I remember the great old Family Bible, the hymn-book,
the chair where father used to sit. I see him as he
looked bending over that Bible more than in any other
way; and expressions and sentences in his prayers which
fell unheeded on my ears in those days have often come
back to me like comforting angels. We are not aware of
the influence things are having on us till we have left them
far behind in years. When we have summered and wintered
them, and look back on them from changed times and
other days, we find that they were making their mark upon
us, though we knew it not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often admired,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the stateliness and
regularity of family worship in good old families in England,&mdash;the
servants, guests, and children all assembled,&mdash;the
reading of the Scriptures and the daily prayers by the
master or mistress of the family, ending with the united
repetition of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer by all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such assemblage is possible in our country,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;Our servants are for the most part Roman Catholics,
and forbidden by their religion to join with us in acts
of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greater the pity,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is a pity that all
Christians who can conscientiously repeat the Apostles&rsquo;
Creed and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer together should for any reason
be forbidden to do so. It would do more to harmonize
our families, and promote good feeling between masters and
servants, to meet once a day on the religious ground common
to both, than many sermons on reciprocal duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, while the case is so,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t
help it. Our servants cannot unite with us; our daily
prayers are something forbidden to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot in this country,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;give to family
prayer that solemn stateliness which it has in a country
where religion is a civil institution, and masters and servants,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
as a matter of course, belong to one church. Our
prayers must resemble more a private interview with a father
than a solemn act of homage to a king. They must be
more intimate and domestic. The hour of family devotion
should be the children&rsquo;s hour,&mdash;held dear as the interval
when the busy father drops his business and cares, and,
like Jesus of old, takes the little ones in his arms and
blesses them. The child should remember it as the time
when the father always seemed most accessible and loving.
The old family worship of New England lacked this
character of domesticity and intimacy,&mdash;it was stately and
formal, distant and cold; but, whatever were its defects, I
cannot think it an improvement to leave it out altogether,
as too many good sort of people in our day are doing. There
may be practical religion where its outward daily forms are
omitted, but there is assuredly no more of it for the omission.
No man loves God and his neighbor <i>less</i>, is a <i>less</i>
honest and good man, for daily prayers in his household,&mdash;the
chances are quite the other way; and if the spirit of
love rules the family hour, it may prove the source and
spring of all that is good through the day. It seems to be
a solemn duty in the parents thus to make the Invisible
Fatherhood real to their children, who can receive this idea
at first only through outward forms and observances. The
little one thus learns that his father has a Father in heaven,
and that the earthly life he is living is only a sacrament
and emblem,&mdash;a type of the eternal life which infolds it,
and of more lasting relations there. Whether, therefore, it
be the silent grace and silent prayer of the Friends, or the
form of prayer of ritual churches, or the extemporaneous
outpouring of those whose habits and taste lead them to
extempore prayer, in one of these ways there should be
daily outward and visible acts of worship in every family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;about this old question of
Sunday-keeping, Marianne and I are much divided. I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
always for doing something that she thinks isn&rsquo;t the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;Bob is always talking
against our old Puritan fathers, and saying all manner of
hard things about them. He seems to think that all their
ways and doings must of course have been absurd. For my
part, I don&rsquo;t think we are in any danger of being too strict
about anything. It appears to me that in this country
there is a general tendency to let all sorts of old forms and
observances float down-stream, and yet nobody seems quite
to have made up his mind what shall come next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that we realize very fully all the
objections and difficulties of the experiments in living that
we have tried; but the difficulties in others that we are
intending to try have not yet come to light. The Puritan
Sabbath had great and very obvious evils. Its wearisome
restraints and over-strictness cast a gloom on religion, and
arrayed against the day itself the active prejudices that now
are undermining it and threatening its extinction. But it
had great merits and virtues, and produced effects on society
that we cannot well afford to dispense with. The clearing
of a whole day from all possibilities of labor and amusement
necessarily produced a grave and thoughtful people, and a
democratic republic can be carried on by no other. In
lands which have Sabbaths of mere amusement, mere gala
days, republics rise and fall as quick as children&rsquo;s card-houses;
and the reason is, they are built by those whose
political and religious education has been childish. The
common people of Europe have been sedulously nursed on
amusements by the reigning powers, to keep them from
meddling with serious matters; their religion has been
sensuous and sentimental, and their Sabbaths thoughtless
holidays. The common people of New England are educated
to think, to reason, to examine all questions of politics
and religion for themselves; and one deeply thoughtful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
day every week baptizes and strengthens their reflective
and reasoning faculties. The Sunday-schools of Paris are
whirligigs where Young France rides round and round on
little hobby-horses till his brain spins even faster than Nature
made it to spin; and when he grows up, his political
experiments are as whirligig as his Sunday education. If I
were to choose between the Sabbath of France and the old
Puritan Sabbath, I should hold up both hands for the latter,
with all its objectionable features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;cannot we contrive to retain
all that is really valuable of the Sabbath, and to ameliorate
and smooth away what is forbidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the problem of our day,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We do not
want the Sabbath of Continental Europe: it does not suit
democratic institutions; it cannot be made even a quiet or
a safe day, except by means of that ever-present armed
police that exists there. If the Sabbath of America is
simply to be a universal loafing, picnicking, dining-out day,
as it is now with all our foreign population, we shall need
what they have in Europe, the gendarmes at every turn, to
protect the fruit on our trees and the melons in our fields.
People who live a little out from great cities see enough,
and more than enough, of this sort of Sabbath-keeping, with
our loose American police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, our system of government was organized to
go by moral influences as much as mills by water, and Sunday
was the great day for concentrating these influences and
bringing them to bear; and we might just as well break down
all the dams and let out all the water of the Lowell mills,
and expect still to work the looms, as to expect to work our
laws and constitution with European notions of religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true the Puritan Sabbath had its disagreeable
points. So have the laws of Nature. They are of a most
uncomfortable sternness and rigidity; yet for all that, we
would hardly join in a petition to have them repealed, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
made wavering and uncertain for human convenience. We
can bend to them in a thousand ways, and live very comfortably
under them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;Sabbath-keeping is the iron rod of
bigots; they don&rsquo;t allow a man any liberty of his own.
One says it&rsquo;s wicked to write a letter Sunday; another
holds that you must read no book but the Bible; and a
third is scandalized if you take a walk, ever so quietly, in
the fields. There are all sorts of quips and turns. We
may fasten things with pins of a Sunday, but it&rsquo;s wicked
to fasten with needle and thread, and so on, and so on;
and each one, planting himself on his own individual mode
of keeping Sunday, points his guns and frowns severely
over the battlements on his neighbors whose opinions and
practice are different from his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Sabbath days are expressly mentioned
by Saint Paul as among those things concerning which no
man should judge another. It seems to me that the error
as regards the Puritan Sabbath was in representing it, not
as a gift from God to man, but as a tribute of man to God.
Hence all these hagglings and nice questions and exactions
to the uttermost farthing. The holy time must be weighed
and measured. It must begin at twelve o&rsquo;clock of one
night, and end at twelve o&rsquo;clock of another; and from beginning
to end, the mind must be kept in a state of tension
by the effort not to think any of its usual thoughts or do
any of its usual works. The fact is, that the metaphysical,
defining, hair-splitting mind of New England, turning its
whole powers on this one bit of ritual, this one only day of
divine service, which was left of all the feasts and fasts of
the old churches, made of it a thing straiter and stricter
than ever the old Jews dreamed of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Jewish Sabbath entered only into the physical
region, merely enjoining cessation from physical toil.
&lsquo;Thou shalt not <i>labor</i> nor do any <i>work</i>,&rsquo; covered the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
ground. In other respects than this it was a joyful festival,
resembling, in the mode of keeping it, the Christmas
of the modern church. It was a day of social hilarity,&mdash;the
Jewish law strictly forbidding mourning and gloom
during festivals. The people were commanded on feast
days to rejoice before the Lord their God with all their
might. We fancy there were no houses where children
were afraid to laugh, where the voice of social cheerfulness
quavered away in terror lest it should awake a wrathful
God. The Jewish Sabbath was instituted, in the absence
of printing, of books, and of all the advantages of literature,
to be the great means of preserving sacred history,&mdash;a day
cleared from all possibility of other employment than social
and family communion, when the heads of families and the
elders of tribes might instruct the young in those religious
traditions which have thus come down to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Christian Sabbath is meant to supply the same
moral need in that improved and higher state of society
which Christianity introduced. Thus it was changed from
the day representing the creation of the world to the resurrection
day of Him who came to make all things new. The
Jewish Sabbath was buried with Christ in the sepulchre,
and arose with Him, not a Jewish, but a Christian festival,
still holding in itself that provision for man&rsquo;s needs
which the old institution possessed, but with a wider and
more generous freedom of application. It was given to
the Christian world as a day of rest, of refreshment, of hope
and joy, and of worship. The manner of making it such
a day was left open and free to the needs and convenience
of the varying circumstances and characters of those for
whose benefit it was instituted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think there is a deal of
nonsense about Sabbath-keeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a deal of nonsense about everything human
beings have to deal with,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;how to find out what is nonsense?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By clear conceptions,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of what the day is for.
I should define the Sabbath as a divine and fatherly gift to
man,&mdash;a day expressly set apart for the cultivation of his
moral nature. Its object is not merely physical rest and
recreation, but moral improvement. The former are proper
to the day only so far as they are subservient to the latter.
The whole human race have the conscious need of being
made better, purer, and more spiritual; the whole human
race have one common danger of sinking to a mere animal
life under the pressure of labor or in the dissipations of
pleasure; and of the whole human race the proverb holds
good, that what may be done any time is done at no time.
Hence the Heavenly Father appoints one day as a special
season for the culture of man&rsquo;s highest faculties. Accordingly,
whatever ways and practices interfere with the purpose
of the Sabbath as a day of worship and moral culture
should be avoided, and all family arrangements for the day
should be made with reference thereto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold dinners on Sunday, for example,&rdquo; said Bob.
&ldquo;Marianne holds these as prime articles of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;they doubtless are most worthy and merciful,
in giving to the poor cook one day she may call her own,
and rest from the heat of range and cooking-stove. For
the same reason, I would suspend as far as possible all traveling,
and all public labor, on Sunday. The hundreds of
hands that these things require to carry them on are the
hands of human beings, whose right to this merciful pause
of rest is as clear as their humanity. Let them have their
day to look upward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the little ones,&rdquo; said my oldest matron daughter,
who had not as yet spoken,&mdash;&ldquo;they are the problem. Oh,
this weary labor of making children keep Sunday! If I try
it, I have no rest at all myself. If I must talk to them or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
read to them to keep them from play, my Sabbath becomes
my hardest working day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, pray, what commandment of the Bible ever said
children should not play on Sunday?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We are
forbidden to work, and we see the reason why; but lambs
frisk and robins sing on Sunday; and little children, who
are as yet more than half animals, must not be made to
keep the day in the manner proper to our more developed
faculties. As much cheerful, attractive religious instruction
as they can bear without weariness may be given, and then
they may simply be restrained from disturbing others. Say
to the little one, &lsquo;This day we have noble and beautiful
things to think of that interest us deeply: you are a child;
you cannot read and think and enjoy such things as much
as we can; you may play softly and quietly, and remember
not to make a disturbance.&rsquo; I would take a child to public
worship at least once of a Sunday; it forms a good habit in
him. If the sermon be long and unintelligible, there are
the little Sabbath-school books in every child&rsquo;s hands; and
while the grown people are getting what they understand,
who shall forbid a child&rsquo;s getting what is suited to him in
a way that interests him and disturbs nobody? The Sabbath-school
is the child&rsquo;s church and happily it is yearly
becoming a more and more attractive institution. I approve
the custom of those who beautify the Sabbath school-room
with plants, flowers, and pictures, thus making it an attractive
place to the childish eye. The more this custom prevails,
the more charming in after years will be the memories
of Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most especially to be desired that the whole air
and aspect of the day should be one of cheerfulness. Even
the new dresses, new bonnets, and new shoes, in which children
delight of a Sunday, should not be despised. They
have their value in marking the day as a festival; and it is
better for the child to long for Sunday, for the sake of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
little new shoes, than that he should hate and dread it as a
period of wearisome restraint. All the latitude should be
given to children that can be, consistently with fixing in
their minds the idea of a sacred season. I would rather
that the atmosphere of the day should resemble that of a
weekly Thanksgiving than that it should make its mark on
the tender mind only by the memory of deprivations and
restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Marianne always breaking
her heart about my reading on Sunday. Now I hold that
what is bad on Sunday is bad on Monday,&mdash;and what is
good on Monday is good on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot abridge other people&rsquo;s liberty,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;The generous, confiding spirit of Christianity has imposed
not a single restriction upon us in reference to Sunday.
The day is put at our disposal as a good Father hands a
piece of money to his child,&mdash;&lsquo;There it is; take it and
spend it well.&rsquo; The child knows from his father&rsquo;s character
what he means by spending it well, but he is left free
to use his own judgment as to the mode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man conscientiously feels that reading of this or
that description is the best for him as regards his moral
training and improvement, let him pursue it, and let no man
judge him. It is difficult, with the varying temperaments
of men, to decide what are or are not religious books. One
man is more religiously impressed by the reading of history
or astronomy than he would be by reading a sermon. There
may be overwrought and wearied states of the brain and
nerves which require and make proper the diversions of
light literature; and if so, let it be used. The mind must
have its recreations as well as the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for children and young people,&rdquo; said my daughter,&mdash;&ldquo;would
you let them read novels on Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly like asking, Would you let them talk
with people on Sunday? Now people are different; it depends,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
therefore, on who they are. Some are trifling and
flighty, some are positively bad-principled, some are altogether
good in their influence. So of the class of books
called novels. Some are merely frivolous, some are absolutely
noxious and dangerous, others again are written with
a strong moral and religious purpose, and, being vivid and
interesting, produce far more religious effect on the mind
than dull treatises and sermons. The parables of Christ
sufficiently establish the point that there is no inherent objection
to the use of fiction in teaching religious truth.
Good religious fiction, thoughtfully read, may be quite as
profitable as any other reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;that there is
danger in too much fiction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But the chief danger of all that class
of reading is its <i>easiness</i>, and the indolent, careless mental
habits it induces. A great deal of the reading of young
people on all days is really reading to no purpose, its object
being merely present amusement. It is a listless yielding
of the mind to be washed over by a stream which leaves no
fertilizing properties, and carries away by constant wear the
good soil of thought. I should try to establish a barrier
against this kind of reading, not only on Sunday, but on
Monday, on Tuesday, and on all days. Instead, therefore,
of objecting to any particular class of books for Sunday
reading, I should say in general that reading merely for
pastime, without any moral aim, is the thing to be guarded
against. That which inspires no thought, no purpose, which
steals away all our strength and energy, and makes the Sabbath
a day of dreams, is the reading I would object to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So of music. I do not see the propriety of confining
one&rsquo;s self to technical sacred music. Any grave, solemn,
thoughtful, or pathetic music has a proper relation to our
higher spiritual nature, whether it be printed in a church
service-book or on secular sheets. On me, for example,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Beethoven&rsquo;s Sonatas have a far more deeply religious influence
than much that has religious names and words. Music
is to be judged of by its effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;if Sunday is given for our own individual
improvement, I for one should not go to church.
I think I get a great deal more good in staying at home and
reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two considerations to be taken into account
in reference to this matter of church-going,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;One relates to our duty as members of society in keeping
up the influence of the Sabbath, and causing it to be respected
in the community; the other, to the proper disposition
of our time for our own moral improvement. As members
of the community, we should go to church, and do all
in our power to support the outward ordinances of religion.
If a conscientious man makes up his mind that Sunday is a
day for outward acts of worship and reverence, he should
do his own part as an individual towards sustaining these
observances. Even though he may have such mental and
moral resources that as an individual he could gain much
more in solitude than in a congregation, still he owes to the
congregation the influence of his presence and sympathy.
But I have never yet seen the man, however finely gifted
morally and intellectually, whom I thought in the long run
a gainer in either of these respects by the neglect of public
worship. I have seen many who in their pride kept aloof
from the sympathies and communion of their brethren, who
lost strength morally, and deteriorated in ways that made
themselves painfully felt. Sunday is apt in such cases to
degenerate into a day of mere mental idleness and reverie,
or to become a sort of waste-paper box for scraps, odds and
ends of secular affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to those very good people&mdash;and many such there
are&mdash;who go straight on with the work of life on Sunday,
on the plea that &lsquo;to labor is to pray,&rsquo; I simply think they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
are mistaken. In the first place, to labor is <i>not</i> the same
thing as to pray. It may sometimes be as good a thing to
do, and in some cases even a better thing; but it is not the
same thing. A man might as well never write a letter to
his wife, on the plea that making money for her is writing
to her. It may possibly be quite as great a proof of love to
work for a wife as to write to her, but few wives would not
say that both were not better than either alone. Furthermore,
there is no doubt that the intervention of one day of
spiritual rest and aspiration so refreshes a man&rsquo;s whole nature,
and oils the many wheels of existence, that he who
allows himself a weekly Sabbath does more work in the
course of his life for the omission of work on that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young student in a French college, where the examinations
are rigidly severe, found by experience that he succeeded
best in his examination by allowing one day of entire
rest just before it. His brain and nervous system refreshed
in this way carried him through the work better than if
taxed to the last moment. There are men transacting a
large and complicated business who can testify to the same
influence from the repose of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe those Christian people who from conscience
and principle turn their thoughts most entirely out of the
current of worldly cares on Sunday fulfill unconsciously a
great law of health; and that, whether their moral nature
be thereby advanced or not, their brain will work more
healthfully and actively for it, even in physical and worldly
matters. It is because the Sabbath thus harmonizes the
physical and moral laws of our being that the injunction
concerning it is placed among the ten great commandments,
each of which represents some one of the immutable needs
of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is yet another point of family religion that ought
to be thought of,&rdquo; said my wife: &ldquo;I mean the customs of
mourning. If there is anything that ought to distinguish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Christian families from Pagans, it should be their way of
looking at and meeting those inevitable events that must
from time to time break the family chain. It seems to be
the peculiarity of Christianity to shed hope on such events.
And yet it seems to me as if it were the very intention of
many of the customs of society to add tenfold to their gloom
and horror,&mdash;such swathings of black crape, such funereal
mufflings of every pleasant object, such darkening of rooms,
and such seclusion from society and giving up to bitter
thoughts and lamentation. How can little children that
look on such things believe that there is a particle of truth
in all they hear about the joyous and comforting doctrines
which the Bible holds forth for such times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That subject is a difficult one,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Nature
seems to indicate a propriety in some outward expressions
of grief when we lose our friends. All nations agree in
these demonstrations. In a certain degree they are soothing
to sorrow; they are the language of external life made
to correspond to the internal. Wearing mourning has its
advantages. It is a protection to the feelings of the wearer,
for whom it procures sympathetic and tender consideration;
it saves grief from many a hard jostle in the ways of life;
it prevents the necessity of many a trying explanation, and
is the ready apology for many an omission of those tasks to
which sorrow is unequal. For all these reasons I never could
join the crusade which some seem disposed to wage against
it. Mourning, however, ought not to be continued for
years. Its uses are more for the first few months of sorrow,
when it serves the mourner as a safeguard from intrusion,
insuring quiet and leisure in which to reunite the broken
threads of life, and to gather strength for a return to its
duties. But to wear mourning garments and forego society
for two or three years after the loss of any friend, however
dear, I cannot but regard as a morbid, unhealthy nursing
of sorrow, unworthy of a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;to such an unhealthy degree
does this custom prevail, that I have actually known young
girls who have never worn any other dress than mourning,
and consequently never been into society, during the entire
period of their girlhood. First, the death of a father necessitated
three years of funereal garments and abandonment
of social relations; then the death of a brother added
two years more; and before that mourning was well ended,
another of a wide circle of relatives being taken, the
habitual seclusion was still protracted. What must a child
think of the Christian doctrine of life and death who has
never seen life except through black crape? We profess
to believe in a better life to which the departed good are
called,&mdash;to believe in the shortness of our separation,
the certainty of reunion, and that all these events are
arranged in all their relations by an infinite tenderness
which cannot err. Surely, Christian funerals too often
seem to say that affliction &lsquo;cometh of the dust,&rsquo; and not
from above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;after all, death is a horror; you can
make nothing less of it. You can&rsquo;t smooth it over, nor
dress it with flowers; it is what Nature shudders at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is precisely for this reason,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that Christians
should avoid those customs which aggravate and intensify
this natural dread. Why overpower the senses with doleful
and funereal images in the hour of weakness and bereavement,
when the soul needs all her force to rise above the
gloom of earth, and to realize the mysteries of faith?
Why shut the friendly sunshine from the mourner&rsquo;s room?
Why muffle in a white shroud every picture that speaks a
cheerful household word to the eye? Why make a house
look stiff and ghastly and cold as a corpse? In some of
our cities, on the occurrence of a death in the family, all
the shutters on the street are closed and tied with black
crape, and so remain for months. What an oppressive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
gloom must this bring on a house! how like the very
shadow of death! It is enlisting the nerves and the senses
against our religion, and making more difficult the great
duty of returning to life and its interests. I would have
flowers and sunshine in the deserted rooms, and make them
symbolical of the cheerful mansions above, to which our
beloved ones are gone. Home ought to be so religiously
cheerful, so penetrated by the life of love and hope and
Christian faith, that the other world may be made real by
it. Our home life should be a type of the higher life.
Our home should be so sanctified, its joys and its sorrows
so baptized and hallowed, that it shall not be sacrilegious
to think of heaven as a higher form of the same thing,&mdash;a
Father&rsquo;s house in the better country, whose mansions are
many, whose love is perfect, whose joy is eternal.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I <br /><br />WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH HER? OR, THE WOMAN QUESTION</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what will you do with her?&rdquo; said I to my wife.</p>
<p>My wife had just come down from an interview with a
pale, faded-looking young woman in rusty black attire, who
had called upon me on the very common supposition that I
was an editor of the &ldquo;Atlantic Monthly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the by, this is a mistake that brings me, Christopher
Crowfield, many letters that do not belong to me, and which
might with equal pertinency be addressed, &ldquo;To the Man in
the Moon.&rdquo; Yet these letters often make my heart ache,&mdash;they
speak so of people who strive and sorrow and want
help; and it is hard to be called on in plaintive tones for
help which you know it is perfectly impossible for you to
give.</p>
<p>For instance, you get a letter in a delicate hand, setting
forth the old distress,&mdash;she is poor, and she has looking to
her for support those that are poorer and more helpless than
herself: she has tried sewing, but can make little at it;
tried teaching, but cannot now get a school,&mdash;all places
being filled, and more than filled; at last has tried literature,
and written some little things, of which she sends you
a modest specimen, and wants your opinion whether she can
gain her living by writing. You run over the articles, and
perceive at a glance that there is no kind of hope or use in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
her trying to do anything at literature; and then you ask
yourself mentally, &ldquo;What is to be done with her? What
can she do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the application that had come to me this morning,&mdash;only,
instead of by note, it came, as I have said, in
the person of the applicant, a thin, delicate, consumptive-looking
being, wearing that rusty mourning which speaks
sadly at once of heart bereavement and material poverty.</p>
<p>My usual course is to turn such cases over to Mrs. Crowfield;
and it is to be confessed that this worthy woman
spends a large portion of her time, and wears out an extraordinary
amount of shoe-leather, in performing the duties of
a self-constituted intelligence office. Talk of giving money
to the poor! what is that, compared to giving sympathy,
thought, time, taking their burdens upon you, sharing their
perplexities? They who are able to buy off every application
at the door of their heart with a five or ten dollar bill
are those who free themselves at least expense.</p>
<p>My wife had communicated to our friend, in the gentlest
tones and in the blandest manner, that her poor little pieces,
however interesting to her own household circle, had nothing
in them wherewith to enable her to make her way in the
thronged and crowded thoroughfare of letters,&mdash;that they
had no more strength or adaptation to win bread for her
than a broken-winged butterfly to draw a plough; and it
took some resolution in the background of her tenderness to
make the poor applicant entirely certain of this. In cases
like this, absolute certainty is the very greatest, the only
true kindness.</p>
<p>It was grievous, my wife said, to see the discouraged
shade which passed over her thin, tremulous features when
this certainty forced itself upon her. It is hard, when sinking
in the waves, to see the frail bush at which the hand
clutches uprooted; hard, when alone in the crowded thoroughfare
of travel, to have one&rsquo;s last bank-note declared a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
counterfeit. I knew I should not be able to see her face,
under the shade of this disappointment; and so, coward that
I was, I turned this trouble, where I have turned so many
others, upon my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what shall we do with her?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said my wife musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could get that school in Taunton for
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible; Mr. Herbert told me he had already twelve
applicants for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get her plain sewing? Is she handy
with her needle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has tried that, but it brings on a pain in her side,
and cough; and the doctor has told her it will not do for
her to confine herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is her handwriting? Does she write a good
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only passable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was thinking if I could get Steele
and Simpson to give her law papers to copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have more copyists than they need now; and, in
fact, this woman does not write the sort of hand at all that
would enable her to get on as a copyist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, turning uneasily in my chair, and at last
hitting on a bright masculine expedient, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what must be done. She must get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;marrying for a living is the
very hardest way a woman can take to get it. Even marrying
for love often turns out badly enough. Witness poor
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane was one of the large number of people whom it
seemed my wife&rsquo;s fortune to carry through life on her back.
She was a pretty, smiling, pleasing daughter of Erin, who
had been in our family originally as nursery-maid. I
had been greatly pleased in watching a little idyllic affair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
growing up between her and a joyous, good-natured young
Irishman, to whom at last we married her. Mike soon
after, however, took to drinking and unsteady courses; and
the result has been to Jane only a yearly baby, with poor
health and no money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;if Jane had only kept single,
she could have made her own way well enough, and might
have now been in good health and had a pretty sum in the
savings bank. As it is, I must carry not only her, but her
three children, on my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to drop her, my dear. You really ought
not to burden yourself with other people&rsquo;s affairs as you
do,&rdquo; said I inconsistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I drop her? Can I help knowing that she
is poor and suffering? And if I drop her, who will take
her up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there is a way of getting rid of cases of this kind,
spoken of in a quaint old book, which occurred strongly to
me at this moment:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily
food, and one of you say unto them, &lsquo;Depart in peace, be
ye warmed and filled,&rsquo; notwithstanding ye give them not
those things which are needful to the body, what doth it
profit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess, notwithstanding the strong point of the
closing question, I looked with an evil eye of longing on
this very easy way of disposing of such cases. A few sympathizing
words, a few expressions of hope that I did not
feel, a line written to turn the case into somebody else&rsquo;s
hands,&mdash;any expedient, in fact, to hide the longing eyes
and imploring hands from my sight,&mdash;was what my carnal
nature at this moment greatly craved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said my wife, resuming the thread of her
thoughts in regard to the subject just now before us, &ldquo;as
to marriage, it&rsquo;s out of the question at present for this poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
child; for the man she loved and would have married lies
low in one of the graves before Richmond. It&rsquo;s a sad
story,&mdash;one of a thousand like it. She brightened for a
few moments, and looked almost handsome, when she spoke
of his bravery and goodness. Her father and lover have
both died in this war. Her only brother has returned from
it a broken-down cripple, and she has him and her poor old
mother to care for, and so she seeks work. I told her to
come again to-morrow, and I would look about for her a
little to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, how many are now down on your list to
be looked about for, Mrs. Crowfield?&mdash;some twelve or
thirteen, are there not? You&rsquo;ve got Tom&rsquo;s sister disposed
of finally, I hope,&mdash;that&rsquo;s a comfort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry to say she came back on my hands
yesterday,&rdquo; said my wife patiently. &ldquo;She is a foolish
young thing, and said she didn&rsquo;t like living out in the
country. I&rsquo;m sorry, because the Morrises are an excellent
family, and she might have had a life home there, if she
had only been steady, and chosen to behave herself properly.
But yesterday I found her back on her mother&rsquo;s hands
again; and the poor woman told me that the dear child
never could bear to be separated from her, and that she
hadn&rsquo;t the heart to send her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in short,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she gave you notice that you
must provide for Miss O&rsquo;Connor in some more agreeable
way. Cross that name off your list, at any rate. That
woman and girl need a few hard raps in the school of experience
before you can do anything for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall,&rdquo; said my long-suffering wife; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
a pity to see a young thing put in the direct road to ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the inevitables,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and we must save
our strength for those that are willing to help themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this talk about?&rdquo; said Bob, coming in
upon us rather brusquely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as usual, the old question,&rdquo; said I,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s
to be done with her?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve come to talk
with mother about. Since she keeps a distressed women&rsquo;s
agency office, I&rsquo;ve come to consult her about Marianne.
That woman will die before six months are out, a victim to
high civilization and the Paddies. There we are, twelve
miles out from Boston, in a country villa so convenient that
every part of it might almost do its own work,&mdash;everything
arranged in the most convenient, contiguous, self-adjusting,
self-acting, patent-right, perfective manner,&mdash;and
yet I tell you Marianne will die of that house. It will
yet be recorded on her tombstone, &lsquo;Died of conveniences.&rsquo;
For myself, what I languish for is a log-cabin, with a bed
in one corner, a trundle-bed underneath for the children, a
fireplace only six feet off, a table, four chairs, one kettle,
a coffee-pot, and a tin baker,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I lived deliciously
in an establishment of this kind last summer, when
I was up at Lake Superior; and I am convinced, if I could
move Marianne into it at once, that she would become a
healthy and a happy woman. Her life is smothered out
of her with comforts; we have too many rooms, too many
carpets, too many vases and knick-knacks, too much china
and silver; she has too many laces and dresses and bonnets;
the children all have too many clothes: in fact, to
put it scripturally, our riches are corrupted, our garments
are moth-eaten, our gold and our silver is cankered, and, in
short, Marianne is sick in bed, and I have come to the
agency office for distressed women to take you out to attend
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; continued Bob, &ldquo;that since our cook married,
and Alice went to California, there seems to be no
possibility of putting our domestic cabinet upon any permanent
basis. The number of female persons that have been
through our house, and the ravages they have wrought on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
it for the last six months, pass belief. I had yesterday a
bill of sixty dollars&rsquo; plumbing to pay for damages of various
kinds which had had to be repaired in our very convenient
water-works; and the blame of each particular one had been
bandied like a shuttlecock among our three household divinities.
Biddy privately assured my wife that Kate was in
the habit of emptying dustpans of rubbish into the main
drain from the chambers, and washing any little extra bits
down through the bowls; and, in fact, when one of the
bathing-room bowls had overflowed so as to damage the
frescoes below, my wife, with great delicacy and precaution,
interrogated Kate as to whether she had followed her instructions
in the care of the water-pipes. Of course she
protested the most immaculate care and circumspection.
&lsquo;Sure, and she knew how careful one ought to be, and
wasn&rsquo;t of the likes of thim as wouldn&rsquo;t mind what throuble
they made,&mdash;like Biddy, who would throw trash and hair
in the pipes, and niver listen to her tellin&rsquo;; sure, and
hadn&rsquo;t she broken the pipes in the kitchen, and lost the
stoppers, as it was a shame to see in a Christian house?&rsquo;
Ann, the third girl, being privately questioned, blamed Biddy
on Monday, and Kate on Tuesday; on Wednesday, however,
she exonerated both; but on Thursday, being in a high
quarrel with both, she departed, accusing them severally,
not only of all the evil practices aforesaid, but of lying and
stealing, and all other miscellaneous wickednesses that came
to hand. Whereat the two thus accused rushed in, bewailing
themselves and cursing Ann in alternate strophes,
averring that she had given the baby laudanum, and, taking
it out riding, had stopped for hours with it in a filthy
lane where the scarlet fever was said to be rife,&mdash;in short,
made so fearful a picture that Marianne gave up the child&rsquo;s
life at once, and has taken to her bed. I have endeavored
all I could to quiet her, by telling her that the scarlet fever
story was probably an extemporaneous work of fiction, got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
up to gratify the Hibernian anger at Ann; and that it
wasn&rsquo;t in the least worth while to believe one thing more
than another from the fact that any of the tribe said it.
But she refuses to be comforted, and is so Utopian as to lie
there crying, &lsquo;Oh, if I only could get one that I could trust,&mdash;one
that would really speak the truth to me,&mdash;one that
I might know really went where she said she went, and
really did as she said she did!&rsquo; To have to live so, she
says, and bring up little children with those she can&rsquo;t trust
out of her sight, whose word is good for nothing,&mdash;to feel
that her beautiful house and her lovely things are all going
to rack and ruin, and she can&rsquo;t take care of them, and can&rsquo;t
see where or when or how the mischief is done,&mdash;in short,
the poor child talks as women do who are violently attacked
with housekeeping fever tending to congestion of the brain.
She actually yesterday told me that she wished, on the
whole, she never had got married, which I take to be the
most positive indication of mental alienation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we behold at this moment two women
dying for the want of what they can mutually give one
another,&mdash;each having a supply of what the other needs,
but held back by certain invisible cobwebs, slight but strong,
from coming to each other&rsquo;s assistance. Marianne has
money enough, but she wants a helper in her family, such
as all her money has been hitherto unable to buy; and
here, close at hand, is a woman who wants home shelter,
healthy, varied, active, cheerful labor, with nourishing food,
kind care, and good wages. What hinders these women
from rushing to the help of one another, just as two drops
of water on a leaf rush together and make one? Nothing
but a miserable prejudice,&mdash;but a prejudice so strong that
women will starve in any other mode of life rather than
accept competency and comfort in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;to propose that our
protégée should go to Marianne as a servant?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I do say it would be the best thing for her to do,&mdash;the
only opening that I see, and a very good one, too, it is.
Just look at it. Her bare living at this moment cannot
cost her less than five or six dollars a week,&mdash;everything
at the present time is so very dear in the city. Now by
what possible calling open to her capacity can she pay her
board and washing, fuel and lights, and clear a hundred and
some odd dollars a year? She could not do it as a district
school teacher; she certainly cannot, with her feeble health,
do it by plain sewing; she could not do it as a copyist. A
robust woman might go into a factory and earn more; but
factory work is unintermitted, twelve hours daily, week in
and out, in the same movement, in close air, amid the clatter
of machinery; and a person delicately organized soon sinks
under it. It takes a stolid, enduring temperament to bear
factory labor. Now look at Marianne&rsquo;s house and family,
and see what is insured to your protégée there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, a home,&mdash;a neat, quiet chamber, quite
as good as she has probably been accustomed to,&mdash;the very
best of food, served in a pleasant, light, airy kitchen, which
is one of the most agreeable rooms in the house, and the
table and table service quite equal to those of most farmers
and mechanics. Then her daily tasks would be light and
varied,&mdash;some sweeping, some dusting, the washing and
dressing of children, the care of their rooms and the nursery,&mdash;all
of it the most healthful, the most natural work
of a woman,&mdash;work alternating with rest, and diverting
thought from painful subjects by its variety, and, what is
more, a kind of work in which a good Christian woman
might have satisfaction, as feeling herself useful in the
highest and best way; for the child&rsquo;s nurse, if she be a
pious, well-educated woman, may make the whole course of
nursery life an education in goodness. Then, what is far
different from any other modes of gaining a livelihood, a
woman in this capacity can make and feel herself really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and truly beloved. The hearts of little children are easily
gained, and their love is real and warm, and no true woman
can become the object of it without feeling her own life
made brighter. Again, she would have in Marianne a sincere,
warm-hearted friend, who would care for her tenderly,
respect her sorrows, shelter her feelings, be considerate of
her wants, and in every way aid her in the cause she has
most at heart,&mdash;the succor of her family. There are many
ways besides her wages in which she would infallibly be
assisted by Marianne, so that the probability would be that
she could send her little salary almost untouched to those
for whose support she was toiling,&mdash;all this on her part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added my wife, &ldquo;on the other hand, she would
be obliged to associate and be ranked with common Irish
servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;is there any occupation, by which
any of us gain our living, which has not its disagreeable
side? Does not the lawyer spend all his days either in a
dusty office or in the foul air of a court-room? Is he not
brought into much disagreeable contact with the lowest
class of society? Are not his labors dry and hard and
exhausting? Does not the blacksmith spend half his life
in soot and grime, that he may gain a competence for the
other half? If this woman were to work in a factory,
would she not often be brought into associations distasteful
to her? Might it not be the same in any of the arts and
trades in which a living is to be got? There must be unpleasant
circumstances about earning a living in any way,
only I maintain that those which a woman would be likely
to meet with as a servant in a refined, well-bred Christian
family would be less than in almost any other calling.
Are there no trials to a woman, I beg to know, in teaching
a district school, where all the boys, big and little,
of a neighborhood congregate? For my part, were it my
daughter or sister who was in necessitous circumstances, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
would choose for her a position such as I name, in a kind,
intelligent, Christian family, before many of those to which
women do devote themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;all this has a good sound enough,
but it&rsquo;s quite impossible. It&rsquo;s true, I verily believe, that
such a kind of servant in our family would really prolong
Marianne&rsquo;s life years,&mdash;that it would improve her health,
and be an unspeakable blessing to her, to me, and the children,&mdash;and
I would almost go down on my knees to a
really well-educated, good American woman who would
come into our family and take that place; but I know it&rsquo;s
perfectly vain and useless to expect it. You know we have
tried the experiment two or three times of having a person
in our family who should be on the footing of a friend, yet
do the duties of a servant, and that we never could make
it work well. These half-and-half people are so sensitive,
so exacting in their demands, so hard to please, that we
have come to the firm determination that we will have no
sliding-scale in our family, and that whoever we are to
depend on must come with bona fide willingness to take
the position of a servant, such as that position is in our
house; and that, I suppose, your protégée would never do,
even if she could thereby live easier, have less hard work,
better health, and quite as much money as she could earn
in any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would consider it a personal degradation, I suppose,&rdquo;
said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, if she only knew it,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I should
respect her far more profoundly for her willingness to take
that position, when adverse fortune has shut other doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this woman is, as I understand,
the daughter of a respectable stone-mason, and the domestic
habits of her early life have probably been economical and
simple. Like most of our mechanics&rsquo; daughters, she has
received in one of our high schools an education which has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
cultivated and developed her mind far beyond those of her
parents and the associates of her childhood. This is a common
fact in our American life. By our high schools the
daughters of plain workingmen are raised to a state of intellectual
culture which seems to make the disposition of
them in any kind of industrial calling a difficult one. They
all want to teach school,&mdash;and schoolteaching, consequently,
is an overcrowded profession,&mdash;and, failing that, there is
only millinery and dressmaking. Of late, it is true, efforts
have been made in various directions to widen their sphere.
Typesetting and bookkeeping are in some instances beginning
to be open to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time there is lying, neglected and despised, a
calling to which womanly talents and instincts are peculiarly
fitted,&mdash;a calling full of opportunities of the most
lasting usefulness; a calling which insures a settled home,
respectable protection, healthful exercise, good air, good food,
and good wages; a calling in which a woman may make real
friends, and secure to herself warm affection: and yet this
calling is the one always refused, shunned, contemned, left
to the alien and the stranger, and that simply and solely
because it bears the name of <i>servant</i>. A Christian woman,
who holds the name of Christ in her heart in true
devotion, would think it the greatest possible misfortune
and degradation to become like him in taking upon her
&lsquo;the form of a servant.&rsquo; The founder of Christianity says:
&lsquo;Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that
serveth? But <i>I</i> am among you as he that serveth.&rsquo; But
notwithstanding these so plain declarations of Jesus, we
find that scarce any one in a Christian land will accept real
advantages of position and employment that come with
that name and condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I could prevail upon this
woman to do all the duties of the situation, if she could be,
as they phrase it, &lsquo;treated as one of the family.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;if she could sit with us at
the same table, be introduced to our friends, and be in all
respects as one of us. Now, as to this, I am free to say
that I have no false aristocratic scruples. I consider every
well-educated woman as fully my equal, not to say my superior;
but it does not follow from this that she would be
one whom I should wish to make a third party with me
and my wife at meal-times. Our meals are often our seasons
of privacy,&mdash;the times when we wish in perfect unreserve
to speak of matters that concern ourselves and our
family alone. Even invited guests and family friends
would not be always welcome, however agreeable at times.
Now a woman may be perfectly worthy of respect, and we
may be perfectly respectful to her, whom nevertheless we
do not wish to take into the circle of intimate friendship.
I regard the position of a woman who comes to perform
domestic service as I do any other business relation. We
have a very respectable young lady in our employ who
does legal copying for us, and all is perfectly pleasant and
agreeable in our mutual relations; but the case would be far
otherwise were she to take it into her head that we treated
her with contempt, because my wife did not call on her, and
because she was not occasionally invited to tea. Besides,
I apprehend that a woman of quick sensibilities, employed
in domestic service, and who was so far treated as a member
of the family as to share our table, would find her position
even more painful and embarrassing than if she took once
for all the position of a servant. We could not control the
feelings of our friends; we could not always insure that
they would be free from aristocratic prejudice, even were
we so ourselves. We could not force her upon their acquaintance,
and she might feel far more slighted than she
would in a position where no attentions of any kind were to
be expected. Besides which, I have always noticed that
persons standing in this uncertain position are objects of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
peculiar antipathy to the servants in full; that they are the
cause of constant and secret cabals and discontents; and
that a family where the two orders exist has always raked
up in it the smouldering embers of a quarrel ready at any
time to burst out into open feud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here lies the problem of American life.
Half our women, like Marianne, are being faded and made
old before their time by exhausting endeavors to lead a life
of high civilization and refinement with only such untrained
help as is washed up on our shores by the tide of emigration.
Our houses are built upon a plan that precludes the necessity
of much hard labor, but requires rather careful and nice
handling. A well-trained, intelligent woman, who had vitalized
her finger-ends by means of a well-developed brain,
could do all the work of such a house with comparatively
little physical fatigue. So stands the case as regards our
houses. Now, over against the women that are perishing in
them from too much care, there is another class of American
women that are wandering up and down, perishing for lack
of some remunerating employment. That class of women,
whose developed brains and less developed muscles mark
them as peculiarly fitted for the performance of the labors of
a high civilization, stand utterly aloof from paid domestic
service. Sooner beg, sooner starve, sooner marry for money,
sooner hang on as dependents in families where they know
they are not wanted, than accept of a quiet home, easy,
healthful work, and certain wages, in these refined and
pleasant modern dwellings of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the reason of this?&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason is, that we have not yet come to the full
development of Christian democracy. The taint of old aristocracies
is yet pervading all parts of our society. We have
not yet realized fully the true dignity of labor, and the surpassing
dignity of domestic labor. And I must say that
the valuable and courageous women who have agitated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
doctrines of Woman&rsquo;s Rights among us have not in all
things seen their way clear in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of those creatures,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;those
men-women, those anomalies, neither flesh nor fish, with
their conventions, and their cracked woman-voices strained
in what they call public speaking, but which I call public
squeaking! No man reverences true women more than I
do. I hold a real, true, thoroughly good <i>woman</i>, whether
in my parlor or my kitchen, as my superior. She can always
teach me something that I need to know. She has
always in her somewhat of the divine gift of prophecy; but
in order to keep it, she must remain a woman. When she
crops her hair, puts on pantaloons, and strides about in conventions,
she is an abortion, and not a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;after all, speak with deference.
We that choose to wear soft clothing and dwell in kings&rsquo;
houses must respect the Baptists, who wear leathern girdles,
and eat locusts and wild honey. They are the voices crying
in the wilderness, preparing the way for a coming good.
They go down on their knees in the mire of life to lift up
and brighten and restore a neglected truth; and we that
have not the energy to share their struggle should at least
refrain from criticising their soiled garments and ungraceful
action. There have been excrescences, eccentricities, peculiarities,
about the camp of these reformers; but the body
of them have been true and noble women, and worthy of
all the reverence due to such. They have already in many
of our States reformed the laws relating to woman&rsquo;s position,
and placed her on a more just and Christian basis.
It is through their movements that in many of our States
a woman can hold the fruits of her own earnings, if it be
her ill luck to have a worthless, drunken spendthrift for
a husband. It is owing to their exertions that new trades
and professions are opening to woman; and all that I have
to say to them is, that in the suddenness of their zeal for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
opening new paths for her feet, they have not sufficiently
considered the propriety of straightening, widening, and
mending the one broad, good old path of domestic labor,
established by God himself. It does appear to me, that,
if at least a portion of their zeal could be spent in removing
the stones out of this highway of domestic life, and
making it pleasant and honorable, they would effect even
more. I would not have them leave undone what they are
doing; but I would, were I worthy to be considered, humbly
suggest to their prophetic wisdom and enthusiasm, whether,
in this new future of women which they wish to introduce,
women&rsquo;s natural, God-given employment of <i>domestic service</i>
is not to receive a new character, and rise in a new form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To love and serve&rsquo; is a motto worn with pride on some
aristocratic family shields in England. It ought to be graven
on the Christian shield. <i>Servant</i> is the name which Christ
gives to the <i>Christian</i>; and in speaking of his kingdom as
distinguished from earthly kingdoms, he distinctly said, that
rank there should be conditioned, not upon desire to command,
but on willingness to serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion
over them, and they that are great exercise authority
upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your minister;
and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
<i>servant</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it, that this name of servant, which Christ says
is the highest in the kingdom of heaven, is so dishonored
among us professing Christians, that good women will beg
or starve, will suffer almost any extreme of poverty and privation,
rather than accept home, competence, security, with
this honored name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fault with many of our friends of the Woman&rsquo;s
Rights order,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;is the depreciatory tone in
which they have spoken of the domestic labors of a family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
as being altogether below the scope of the faculties of woman.
&lsquo;<i>Domestic drudgery</i>&rsquo; they call it,&mdash;an expression
that has done more harm than any two words that ever were
put together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of a woman&rsquo;s calling clear-starching and ironing
domestic drudgery, and to better the matter turning to typesetting
in a grimy printing office! Call the care of china
and silver, the sweeping of carpets, the arrangement of parlors
and sitting-rooms, drudgery; and go into a factory and
spend the day amid the whir and clatter and thunder of
machinery, inhaling an atmosphere loaded with wool and
machine grease, and keeping on the feet for twelve hours,
nearly <ins title="Was continously">continuously</ins>! Think of its being called drudgery to
take care of a clean, light, airy nursery, to wash and dress
and care for two or three children, to mend their clothes,
tell them stories, make them playthings, take them out walking
or driving; and rather than this, to wear out the whole
livelong day, extending often deep into the night, in endless
sewing, in a close room of a dressmaking establishment! Is
it any less drudgery to stand all day behind a counter, serving
customers, than to tend a doorbell and wait on a table?
For my part,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I have often thought the
matter over, and concluded, that, if I were left in straitened
circumstances, as many are in a great city, I would seek a
position as a servant in one of our good families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy the family that you even think of in that connection,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I fancy the amazement which would
take possession of them as you began to develop among
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always held,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that family work,
in many of its branches, can be better performed by an
educated woman than an uneducated one. Just as an army
where even the bayonets think is superior to one of mere
brute force and mechanical training, so, I have heard it said,
some of our distinguished modern female reformers show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
an equal superiority in the domestic sphere,&mdash;and I do not
doubt it. Family work was never meant to be the special
province of untaught brains. I have sometimes thought I
should like to show what I could do as a servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;to return from all this to the question,
What&rsquo;s to be done with her? Are you going to <i>my</i>
distressed woman? If you are, suppose you take <i>your</i> distressed
woman along, and ask her to try it. I can promise
her a pleasant house, a quiet room by herself, healthful and
not too hard work, a kind friend, and some leisure for reading,
writing, or whatever other pursuit of her own she may
choose for her recreation. We are always quite willing to
lend books to any who appreciate them. Our house is surrounded
by pleasant grounds, which are open to our servants
as to ourselves. So let her come and try us. I am quite
sure that country air, quiet security, and moderate exercise
in a good home, will bring up her health; and if she is
willing to take the one or two disagreeables which may
come with all this, let her try us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so be it; and would that all the women
seeking homes and employment could thus fall in with
women who have homes and are perishing in them for want
of educated helpers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this question of woman&rsquo;s work I have yet more to
say, but must defer it till another time.</p>

<h3>II <br /><br />WOMAN&rsquo;S SPHERE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this Woman&rsquo;s Rights question?&rdquo;
said Bob Stephens. &ldquo;From some of your remarks, I apprehend
that you think there is something in it. I may be
wrong, but I must confess that I have looked with disgust
on the whole movement. No man reverences women as I
do; but I reverence them <i>as</i> women. I reverence them for
those very things in which their sex differs from ours; but
when they come upon our ground, and begin to work and
fight after our manner and with our weapons, I regard them
as fearful anomalies, neither men nor women. These Woman&rsquo;s
Rights Conventions appear to me to have ventilated
crudities, absurdities, and blasphemies. To hear them talk
about men, one would suppose that the two sexes were
natural-born enemies, and wonder whether they ever had
fathers and brothers. One would think, upon their showing,
that all men were a set of ruffians, in league against
women,&mdash;they seeming, at the same time, to forget how
on their very platforms the most constant and gallant
defenders of their rights are men. Wendell Phillips and
Wentworth Higginson have put at the service of the cause
masculine training and manly vehemence, and complacently
accepted the wholesale abuse of their own sex at the hands
of their warrior sisters. One would think, were all they
say of female powers true, that our Joan-of-Arcs ought to
have disdained to fight under male captains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that, in all this talk about
the rights of men, and the rights of women, and the rights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
of children, the world seems to be forgetting what is quite
as important, the <i>duties</i> of men and women and children.
We all hear of our <i>rights</i> till we forget our <i>duties</i>; and
even theology is beginning to concern itself more with what
man has a right to expect of his Creator than what the
Creator has a right to expect of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the truth,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;there is danger of just
this overaction; and yet rights must be discussed; because,
in order to understand the duties we owe to any class, we
must understand their rights. To know our duties to men,
women, and children, we must know what the rights of
men, women, and children justly are. As to the &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s
Rights movement,&rsquo; it is not peculiar to America, it is part
of a great wave in the incoming tide of modern civilization;
the swell is felt no less in Europe, but it combs over and
breaks on our American shore, because our great wide beach
affords the best play for its waters; and as the ocean waves
bring with them kelp, seaweed, mud, sand, gravel, and
even putrefying débris, which lie unsightly on the shore,
and yet, on the whole, are healthful and refreshing,&mdash;so
the Woman&rsquo;s Rights movement, with its conventions, its
speech-makings, its crudities, and eccentricities, is nevertheless
a part of a healthful and necessary movement of the
human race towards progress. This question of Woman
and her Sphere is now, perhaps, the greatest of the age.
We have put Slavery under foot, and with the downfall of
Slavery the only obstacle to the success of our great democratic
experiment is overthrown, and there seems no limit
to the splendid possibilities which it may open before the
human race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the reconstruction that is now coming there lies
more than the reconstruction of States and the arrangement
of the machinery of government. We need to know and
feel, all of us, that, from the moment of the death of Slavery,
we parted finally from the régime and control of all the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
ideas formed under old oppressive systems of society, and
came upon a new plane of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this new life we must never forget that we are a
peculiar people, that we have to walk in paths unknown to
the Old World,&mdash;paths where its wisdom cannot guide us,
where its precedents can be of little use to us, and its criticisms,
in most cases, must be wholly irrelevant. The history
of our war has shown us of how little service to us
in any important crisis the opinions and advice of the Old
World can be. We have been hurt at what seemed to us
the want of sympathy, the direct antagonism, of England.
We might have been less hurt if we had properly understood
that Providence had placed us in a position so far ahead of
her ideas or power of comprehension that just judgment or
sympathy was not to be expected from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we went through our great war with no help but
that of God, obliged to disregard the misconceptions and
impertinences which the foreign press rained down upon us,
so, if we are wise, we shall continue to do. Our object
must now be to make the principles on which our government
is founded permeate consistently the mass of society,
and to purge out the leaven of aristocratic and Old World
ideas. So long as there is an illogical working in our
actual life, so long as there is any class denied equal rights
with other classes, so long will there be agitation and
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;you believe that women ought
to vote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the principle on which we founded our government
is true, that taxation must not exist without representation,
and if women hold property and are taxed, it follows that
women should be represented in the State by their votes,
or there is an illogical working of our government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, don&rsquo;t you think that this will have a bad
effect on the female character?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it will make women caucus holders,
political candidates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may make this of some women, just as of some men,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;But all men do not take any great interest in
politics; it is very difficult to get some of the best of them
to do their duty in voting, and the same will be found true
among women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;what do you gain? What
will a woman&rsquo;s vote be but a duplicate of that of her husband
or father, or whatever man happens to be her adviser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be true on a variety of questions; but there
are subjects on which the vote of women would, I think, be
essentially different from that of men. On the subjects of
temperance, public morals, and education, I have no doubt
that the introduction of the female vote into legislation, in
States, counties, and cities, would produce results very different
from that of men alone. There are thousands of
women who would close grog-shops, and stop the traffic in
spirits, if they had the legislative power; and it would be
well for society if they had. In fact, I think that a State
can no more afford to dispense with the vote of women in
its affairs than a family. Imagine a family where the female
has no voice in the housekeeping! A State is but a
larger family, and there are many of its concerns which,
equally with those of a private household, would be bettered
by female supervision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fancy women going to those horrible voting-places!
It is more than I can do myself,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that they are horrible and
disgusting principally because women never go to them.
All places where women are excluded tend downward to
barbarism; but the moment she is introduced, there come
in with her courtesy, cleanliness, sobriety, and order. When
a man can walk up to the ballot-box with his wife or his
sister on his arm, voting-places will be far more agreeable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
than now, and the polls will not be such bear-gardens that
refined men will be constantly tempted to omit their political
duties there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If for nothing else, I would have women vote, that the
business of voting may not be so disagreeable and intolerable
to men of refinement as it now is; and I sincerely believe
that the cause of good morals, good order, cleanliness,
and public health would be a gainer not merely by the
added feminine vote, but by the added vote of a great many
excellent but too fastidious men, who are now kept from
the polls by the disagreeables they meet there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that, if women had equal representation
with men in the municipal laws of New York, its reputation
for filth during the last year would have gone so far
beyond that of Cologne, or any other city renowned for bad
smells? I trow not. I believe a lady mayoress would
have brought in a dispensation of brooms and whitewash,
and made a terrible searching into dark holes and vile corners,
before now. Female New York, I have faith to believe,
has yet left in her enough of the primary instincts of
womanhood to give us a clean, healthy city, if female votes
had any power to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;you forget that voting would bring
together all the women of the lower classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but, thanks to the instincts of their sex, they
would come in their Sunday clothes; for where is the
woman that hasn&rsquo;t her finery, and will not embrace every
chance to show it? Biddy&rsquo;s parasol, and hat with pink
ribbons, would necessitate a clean shirt in Pat as much as
on Sunday. Voting would become a fête, and we should
have a population at the polls as well-dressed as at church.
Such is my belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but you go to the full extent
with our modern female reformers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain neglected truths, which have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
held up by these reformers, that are gradually being accepted
and infused into the life of modern society; and their recognition
will help to solidify and purify democratic institutions.
They are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The right of every woman to hold independent
property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. The right of every woman to receive equal pay with
man for work which she does equally well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. The right of any woman to do any work for which,
by her natural organization and talent, she is peculiarly
adapted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the first head, our energetic sisters have already,
by the help of their gallant male adjutants, reformed the
laws of several of our States, so that a married woman is no
longer left the unprotected legal slave of any unprincipled,
drunken spendthrift who may be her husband,&mdash;but, in
case of the imbecility or improvidence of the natural head
of the family, the wife, if she have the ability, can conduct
business, make contracts, earn and retain money for the
good of the household; and I am sure no one can say that
immense injustice and cruelty are not thereby prevented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite easy for women who have the good fortune
to have just and magnanimous husbands to say that they
feel no interest in such reforms, and that they would willingly
trust their property to the man to whom they give
themselves; but they should remember that laws are not
made for the restraint of the generous and just, but of the
dishonest and base. The law which enables a married
woman to hold her own property does not forbid her to give
it to the man of her heart, if she so pleases; and it does
protect many women who otherwise would be reduced to
the extremest misery. I once knew an energetic milliner
who had her shop attached four times, and a flourishing
business broken up in four different cities, because she was
tracked from city to city by a worthless spendthrift, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
only waited till she had amassed a little property in a new
place to swoop down upon and carry it off. It is to be
hoped that the time is not distant when every State will
give to woman a fair chance to the ownership and use of her
own earnings and her own property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the head of the right of every woman to do any
work for which by natural organization and talent she is
especially adapted, there is a word or two to be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The talents and tastes of the majority of women are
naturally domestic. The family is evidently their sphere,
because in all ways their organization fits them for that
more than for anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are occasionally women who are exceptions
to the common law, gifted with peculiar genius and adaptations.
With regard to such women, there has never seemed
to be any doubt in the verdict of mankind that they ought
to follow their nature, and that their particular sphere was
the one to which they are called. Did anybody ever think
that Mrs. Siddons and Mrs. Kemble and Ristori had better
have applied themselves sedulously to keeping house, because
they were women, and &lsquo;woman&rsquo;s noblest station is
retreat&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has always shown a fair average of good
sense in this matter, from the days of the fair Hypatia in
Alexandria, who, we are told, gave lectures on philosophy
behind a curtain, lest her charms should distract the attention
of too impressible young men, down to those of Anna
Dickinson. Mankind are not, after all, quite fools, and
seem in these cases to have a reasonable idea that exceptional
talents have exceptional laws, and make their own
code of proprieties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there is no doubt that Miss Dickinson, though as
relating to her femininity she is quite as pretty and modest
a young woman as any to be found in the most sheltered
circle, has yet a most exceptional talent for public speaking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
which draws crowds to hear her, and makes lecturing for
her a lucrative profession, as well as a means of advocating
just and generous sentiments, and of stimulating her own
sex to nobler purposes; and the same law which relates to
Siddons and Kemble and Ristori relates also to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctrine of <i>vocations</i> is a good one and a safe one.
If a woman mistakes her vocation, so much the worse for
her; the world does not suffer, but she does, and the suffering
speedily puts her where she belongs. There is not near
so much danger from attempts to imitate Anna Dickinson
as there is from the more common feminine attempts to
rival the <i>demi-monde</i> of Paris in fantastic extravagance and
luxury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to how a woman may determine whether she has
any such vocation, there is a story quite in point. A good
Methodist elder was listening to an ardent young mechanic
who thought he had a call to throw up his shop and go to
preaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I feel,&rsquo; said the young ardent, &lsquo;that I have a call to
preach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hast thou noticed whether people seem to have a call
to hear thee?&rsquo; said the shrewd old man. &lsquo;I have always
noticed that a true call of the Lord may be known by this,
that people have a <i>call</i> to hear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;the most interesting question still
remains: What are to be the employments of woman?
What ways are there for her to use her talents, to earn her
livelihood and support those who are dear to her, when
Providence throws that necessity upon her? This is becoming
more than ever one of the pressing questions of our
age. The war has deprived so many thousands of women
of their natural protectors, that everything must be thought
of that may possibly open a way for their self-support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us look over the field,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;What
is there for woman?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come the professions requiring
natural genius,&mdash;authorship, painting, sculpture,
with the subordinate arts of photographing, coloring, and
finishing; but when all is told, these furnish employment
to a very limited number,&mdash;almost as nothing to the whole.
Then there is teaching, which is profitable in its higher
branches, and perhaps the very pleasantest of all the callings
open to woman; but teaching is at present an overcrowded
profession, the applicants everywhere outnumbering
the places. Architecture and landscape gardening are arts
every way suited to the genius of woman, and there are
enough who have the requisite mechanical skill and mathematical
education; and, though never yet thought of for the
sex, that I know of, I do not despair of seeing those who
shall find in this field a profession at once useful and elegant.
When women plan dwelling-houses, the vast body
of tenements to be let in our cities will wear a more domestic
and comfortable air, and will be built more with reference
to the real wants of their inmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;that agencies of various
sorts, as canvassing the country for the sale of books, maps,
and engravings, might properly employ a great many
women. There is a large class whose health suffers from
confinement and sedentary occupations, who might, I think,
be both usefully and agreeably employed in business of this
sort, and be recruiting their health at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;there is the medical profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The world is greatly obliged to Miss
Blackwell and other noble pioneers who faced and overcame
the obstacles to the attainment of a thorough medical education
by females. Thanks to them, a new and lucrative
profession is now open to educated women in relieving the
distresses of their own sex; and we may hope that in time,
through their intervention, the care of the sick may also
become the vocation of cultivated, refined, intelligent women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
instead of being left, as heretofore, to the ignorant
and vulgar. The experience of our late war has shown us
what women of a high class morally and intellectually can
do in this capacity. Why should not this experience inaugurate
a new and sacred calling for refined and educated
women? Why should not <span class='smcaplc'>NURSING</span> become a vocation
equal in dignity and in general esteem to the medical profession,
of which it is the right hand? Why should our
dearest hopes, in the hour of their greatest peril, be committed
into the hands of Sairey Gamps, when the world has
seen Florence Nightingales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;I can testify, from my
own experience, that the sufferings and dangers of the sickbed,
for the want of intelligent, educated nursing, have been
dreadful. A prejudiced, pig-headed, snuff-taking old woman,
narrow-minded and vulgar, and more confident in her own
way than seven men that can render a reason, enters your
house at just the hour and moment when all your dearest
earthly hopes are brought to a crisis. She becomes absolute
dictator over your delicate, helpless wife and your frail
babe,&mdash;the absolute dictator of all in the house. If it be
her sovereign will and pleasure to enact all sorts of physiological
absurdities in the premises, who shall say her nay?
&lsquo;She knows her business, she hopes!&rsquo; And if it be her
edict, as it was of one of her class whom I knew, that each
of her babies shall eat four baked beans the day it is four
days old, eat them it must; and if the baby die in convulsions
four days after, it is set down as the mysterious will
of an overruling Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know and have seen women lying upon laced pillows,
under silken curtains, who have been bullied and dominated
over in the hour of their greatest helplessness by ignorant
and vulgar tyrants, in a way that would scarce be thought
possible in civilized society, and children that have been
injured or done to death by the same means. A celebrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
physician told me of a babe whose eyesight was nearly
ruined by its nurse taking a fancy to wash its eyes with
camphor,&mdash;&lsquo;to keep it from catching cold,&rsquo; she said. I
knew another infant that was poisoned by the nurse giving
it laudanum in some of those patent nostrums which these
ignorant creatures carry secretly in their pockets, to secure
quiet in their little charges. I knew one delicate woman who
never recovered from the effects of being left at her first
confinement in the hands of an ill-tempered, drinking nurse,
and whose feeble infant was neglected and abused by this
woman in a way to cause lasting injury. In the first four
weeks of infancy the constitution is peculiarly impressible;
and infants of a delicate organization may, if frightened and
ill-treated, be the subjects of just such a shock to the nervous
system as in mature age comes from the sudden stroke
of a great affliction or terror. A bad nurse may affect
nerves predisposed to weakness in a manner they never will
recover from. I solemnly believe that the constitutions of
more women are broken up by bad nursing in their first
confinement than by any other cause whatever. And yet
there are at the same time hundreds and thousands of
women, wanting the means of support, whose presence in a
sick-room would be a benediction. I do trust that Miss
Blackwell&rsquo;s band of educated nurses will not be long in
coming, and that the number of such may increase till they
effect a complete revolution in this vocation. A class of
cultivated, well-trained, intelligent nurses would soon elevate
the employment of attending on the sick into the noble
calling it ought to be, and secure for it its appropriate
rewards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another opening for woman,&rdquo; said I,&mdash;&ldquo;in
the world of business. The system of commercial colleges
now spreading over our land is a new and most important
development of our times. There that large class of young
men who have either no time or no inclination for an extended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
classical education can learn what will fit them for
that active material life which in our broad country needs
so many workers. But the most pleasing feature of these
institutions is, that the complete course is open to women
no less than to men, and women there may acquire that
knowledge of bookkeeping and accounts, and of the forms
and principles of business transactions, which will qualify
them for some of the lucrative situations hitherto monopolized
by the other sex. And the expenses of the course
of instruction are so arranged as to come within the scope
of very moderate means. A fee of fifty dollars entitles a
woman to the benefit of the whole course, and she has the
privilege of attending at any hours that may suit her own
engagements and convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;there are the departments
of millinery and dressmaking, and the various branches
of needlework, which afford employment to thousands of
women; there is typesetting, by which many are beginning
to get a living; there are the manufactures of cotton, woolen,
silk, and the numberless useful articles which employ female
hands in their fabrication,&mdash;all of them opening avenues
by which, with more or less success, a subsistence can be
gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it would appear, after all,
that there are abundance of openings for women. What is
the cause of the outcry and distress? How is it that we
hear of women starving, driven to vice and crime by want,
when so many doors of useful and profitable employment
stand open to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question would easily be solved,&rdquo; said my wife,
&ldquo;if you could once see the kind and class of women who
thus suffer and starve. There may be exceptions, but too
large a portion of them are girls and women who can or will
do no earthly thing well,&mdash;and, what is worse, are not willing
to take the pains to be taught to do anything well. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
will describe to you one girl, and you will find in every intelligence-office
a hundred of her kind to five thoroughly
trained ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imprimis: she is rather delicate and genteel-looking,
and you may know from the arrangement of her hair just
what the last mode is of disposing of rats or waterfalls.
She has a lace bonnet with roses, a silk mantilla, a silk
dress trimmed with velvet, a white skirt with sixteen tucks
and an embroidered edge, a pair of cloth gaiters, underneath
which are a pair of stockings without feet, the only pair in
her possession. She has no under-linen, and sleeps at night
in the working-clothes she wears in the day. She never
seems to have in her outfit either comb, brush, or tooth-brush
of her own,&mdash;neither needles, thread, scissors, nor
pins; her money, when she has any, being spent on more
important articles, such as the lace bonnet or silk mantilla,
or the rats and waterfalls that glorify her head. When she
wishes to sew, she borrows what is needful of a convenient
next neighbor; and if she gets a place in a family as second
girl, she expects to subsist in these respects by borrowing of
the better-appointed servants, or helping herself from the
family stores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She expects, of course, the very highest wages, if she
condescends to live out; and by help of a trim outside appearance,
and the many vacancies that are continually occurring
in households, she gets places, where her object is to
do just as little of any duty assigned to her as possible, to
hurry through her performances, put on her fine clothes, and
go a-gadding. She is on free-and-easy terms with all the
men she meets, and ready at jests and repartee, sometimes
far from seemly. Her time of service in any one place lasts
indifferently from a fortnight to two or three months, when
she takes her wages, buys her a new parasol in the latest
style, and goes back to the intelligence-office. In the different
families where she has lived she has been told a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
times the proprieties of household life, how to make
beds, arrange rooms, wash china, glass, and silver, and set
tables; but her habitual rule is to try in each place how
small and how poor services will be accepted. When she
finds less will not do, she gives more. When the mistress
follows her constantly, and shows an energetic determination
to be well served, she shows that she can serve well;
but the moment such attention relaxes, she slides back again.
She is as destructive to a house as a fire; the very spirit of
wastefulness is in her; she cracks the china, dents the silver,
stops the water-pipes with rubbish, and, after she is
gone, there is generally a sum equal to half her wages to be
expended in repairing the effects of her carelessness. And
yet there is one thing to be said for her: she is quite as
careful of her employer&rsquo;s things as of her own. The full
amount of her mischiefs often does not appear at once, as
she is glib of tongue, adroit in apologies, and lies with as
much alertness and as little thought of conscience as a blackbird
chatters. It is difficult for people who have been trained
from childhood in the school of verities,&mdash;who have been
lectured for even the shadow of a prevarication, and shut
up in disgrace for a lie, till truth becomes a habit of their
souls,&mdash;it is very difficult for people so educated to understand
how to get on with those who never speak the truth
except by mere accident, who assert any and every thing that
comes into their heads with all the assurance and all the
energy of perfect verity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of this girl? She finds means, by begging,
borrowing, living out, to keep herself extremely trim
and airy for a certain length of time, till the rats and waterfalls,
the lace hat and parasol, and the glib tongue, have
done their work in making a fool of some honest young
mechanic who earns three dollars a day. She marries him
with no higher object than to have somebody to earn money
for her to spend. And what comes of such marriages?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is one ending of her career; the other is on the
street, in haunts of vice, in prison, in drunkenness, and
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence come these girls? They are as numerous as
yellow butterflies in autumn; they flutter up to cities from
the country; they grow up from mothers who ran the same
sort of career before them; and the reason why in the end
they fall out of all reputable employment and starve on
poor wages is, that they become physically, mentally, and
morally incapable of rendering any service which society
will think worth paying for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the head of the most celebrated
dressmaking establishment in New York, in reply to
the appeals of the needlewomen of the city for sympathy
and wages, came out with published statements to this effect:
that the difficulty lay, not in unwillingness of employers to
pay what work was worth, but in finding any work worth paying
for; that she had many applicants, but among them few
who could be of real use to her; that she, in common with
everybody in this country who has any kind of serious responsibilities
to carry, was continually embarrassed for want
of skilled work-people who could take and go on with the
labor of her various departments without her constant supervision;
that, out of a hundred girls, there would not be
more than five to whom she could give a dress to be made
and dismiss it from her mind as something certain to be
properly done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let people individually look around their own little
sphere, and ask themselves if they know any woman really
excelling in any valuable calling or accomplishment who is
suffering for want of work. All of us know seamstresses,
dressmakers, nurses, and laundresses who have made themselves
such a reputation, and are so beset and overcrowded
with work, that the whole neighborhood is constantly on its
knees to them with uplifted hands. The fine seamstress,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
who can cut and make trousseaus and layettes in elegant perfection,
is always engaged six months in advance; the pet
dressmaker of a neighborhood must be engaged in May for
September, and in September for May; a laundress who
sends your clothes home in nice order always has all the
work that she can do. Good work in any department is
the rarest possible thing in our American life; and it is a
fact that the great majority of workers, both in the family
and out, do only tolerably well,&mdash;not so badly that it actually
cannot be borne, yet not so well as to be a source
of real, thorough satisfaction. The exceptional worker in
every neighborhood, who does things really <i>well</i>, can always
set her own price, and is always having more offering than
she can possibly do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble, then, in finding employment for women
lies deeper than the purses or consciences of the employers:
it lies in the want of education in women; the want of <i>education</i>,
I say,&mdash;meaning by education that which fits a
woman for practical and profitable employment in life, and
not mere common-school learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;for it is a fact that the most
troublesome and helpless persons to provide for are often
those who have a good medium education, but no feminine
habits, no industry, no practical calculation, no muscular
strength, and no knowledge of any one of woman&rsquo;s peculiar
duties. In the earlier days of New England, women, as a
class, had far fewer opportunities for acquiring learning, yet
were far better educated, physically and morally, than now.
The high school did not exist; at the common school they
learned reading, writing, and arithmetic, and practiced spelling;
while at home they did the work of the household.
They were cheerful, bright, and active, ever on the alert,
able to do anything, from the harnessing and driving of a
horse to the finest embroidery. The daughters of New
England in those days looked the world in the face without a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
fear. They shunned no labor; they were afraid of none;
and they could always find their way to a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But although less instructed in school learning,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;they showed no deficiency in intellectual acumen. I
see no such women, nowadays, as some I remember of that
olden time,&mdash;women whose strong minds and ever-active
industry carried on reading and study side by side with
household toils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember a young lady friend of mine, attending a
celebrated boarding-school, boarded in the family of a woman
who had never been to school longer than was necessary
to learn to read and write, yet who was a perfect cyclopedia
of general information. The young scholar used to
take her Chemistry and Natural Philosophy into the kitchen,
where her friend was busy with her household work, and
read her lessons to her, that she might have the benefit of
her explanations; and so, while the good lady scoured her
andirons or kneaded her bread, she lectured to her protégée
on mysteries of science far beyond the limits of the textbook.
Many of the graduates of our modern high schools
would find it hard to shine in conversation on the subjects
they had studied, in the searching presence of some of these
vigorous matrons of the olden time, whose only school had
been the leisure hours gained by energy and method from
their family cares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in those days,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;there lived in our
families a class of American domestics, women of good sense
and good powers of reflection, who applied this sense and
power of reflection to household matters. In the early part
of my married life, I myself had American &lsquo;help&rsquo;; and
they were not only excellent servants, but trusty and invaluable
friends. But now, all this class of applicants for domestic
service have disappeared, I scarce know why or how.
All I know is, there is no more a Betsey or a Lois, such as
used to take domestic cares off my shoulders so completely.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! where are they?&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;Where
do they hide? I would search through the world after
such a prodigy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there has been a slow and gradual
reaction against household labor in America. Mothers
began to feel that it was a sort of <i>curse</i>, to be spared, if
possible, to their daughters; women began to feel that they
were fortunate in proportion as they were able to be entirely
clear of family responsibilities. Then Irish labor
began to come in, simultaneously with a great advance in
female education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long while nothing was talked of, written of,
thought of, in teachers&rsquo; meetings, conventions, and assemblies,
but the neglected state of female education; and the
whole circle of the arts and sciences was suddenly introduced
into our free-school system, from which needlework
as gradually and quietly was suffered to drop out. The
girl who attended the primary and high school had so much
study imposed on her that she had no time for sewing or
housework; and the delighted mother was only too happy
to darn her stockings and do the housework alone, that her
daughter might rise to a higher plane than she herself had
attained to. The daughter, thus educated, had, on coming
to womanhood, no solidity of muscle, no manual dexterity,
no practice or experience in domestic life; and if she were
to seek a livelihood, there remained only teaching, or some
feminine trade, or the factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These factories,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;have been the ruin
of hundreds and hundreds of our once healthy farmers&rsquo;
daughters and others from the country. They go there
young and unprotected; they live there in great boarding-houses,
and associate with a promiscuous crowd, without
even such restraints of maternal supervision as they would
have in great boarding-schools; their bodies are enfeebled
by labor often necessarily carried on in a foul and heated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
atmosphere; and at the hours when off duty, they are exposed
to all the dangers of unwatched intimacy with the
other sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, the factory girl learns and practices but one
thing,&mdash;some one mechanical movement, which gives no
scope for invention, ingenuity, or any other of the powers
called into play by domestic labor; so that she is in reality
unfitted in every way for family duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many times it has been my lot to try, in my family
service, girls who have left factories; and I have found them
wholly useless for any of the things which a woman ought
to be good for. They knew nothing of a house, or what
ought to be done in it; they had imbibed a thorough contempt
of household labor, and looked upon it but as a <i>dernier
ressort</i>; and it was only the very lightest of its tasks that
they could even begin to think of. I remember I tried to
persuade one of these girls, the pretty daughter of a fisherman,
to take some lessons in washing and ironing. She
was at that time engaged to be married to a young mechanic,
who earned something like two or three dollars a
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My child,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you will need to understand all
kinds of housework if you are going to be married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tossed her little head,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, she wasn&rsquo;t going to trouble herself about
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But who will get up your husband&rsquo;s shirts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, he must put them out. I&rsquo;m not going to be married
to make a slave of myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another young factory girl, who came for table and
parlor work, was so full of airs and fine notions that it
seemed as difficult to treat with her as with a princess. She
could not sweep, because it blistered her hands, which, in
fact, were long and delicate; she could not think of putting
them into hot dish-water, and for that reason preferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
washing the dishes in cold water; she required a full hour
in the morning to make her toilet; she was laced so tightly
that she could not stoop without vertigo; and her hoops were
of dimensions which seemed to render it impossible for her
to wait upon table; she was quite exhausted with the effort
of ironing the table-napkins and chamber-towels: yet she
could not think of &lsquo;living out&rsquo; under two dollars a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both these girls had had a good free-school education,
and could read any amount of novels, write a tolerable
letter, but had not learned anything with sufficient accuracy
to fit them for teachers. They were pretty, and their destiny
was to marry and lie a deadweight on the hands of
some honest man, and to increase, in their children, the
number of incapables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;what would you have? What is
to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I would have it felt, by
those who are seeking to elevate woman, that the work is
to be done, not so much by creating for her new spheres
of action as by elevating her conceptions of that domestic
vocation to which God and Nature have assigned her. It is
all very well to open to her avenues of profit and advancement
in the great outer world; but, after all, <i>to make and
keep a home</i> is, and ever must be, a woman&rsquo;s first glory,
her highest aim. No work of art can compare with a perfect
home; the training and guiding of a family must be
recognized as the highest work a woman can perform; and
female education ought to be conducted with special reference
to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are trained to be lawyers, to be physicians, to be
mechanics, by long and self-denying study and practice.
A man cannot even make shoes merely by going to the
high school and learning reading, writing, and mathematics;
he cannot be a bookkeeper or a printer simply from general
education.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now women have a sphere and profession of their own,&mdash;a
profession for which they are fitted by physical organization,
by their own instincts, and to which they are directed
by the pointing and manifest finger of God,&mdash;and
that sphere is <i>family life</i>. Duties to the state and to public
life they may have; but the public duties of women must
bear to their family ones the same relation that the family
duties of men bear to their public ones. The defect in the
late efforts to push on female education is, that it has been
for her merely general, and that it has left out and excluded
all that is professional; and she undertakes the essential
duties of womanhood, when they do devolve on her, without
any adequate preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it possible for a girl to learn at school the things
which fit for her family life?&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Once it was thought impossible
in school to teach girls geometry or algebra, or the
higher mathematics; it was thought impossible to put them
through collegiate courses; but it has been done, and we
see it. Women study treatises on political economy in
schools, and why should not the study of domestic economy
form a part of every school course? A young girl will
stand up at the blackboard, and draw and explain the compound
blowpipe, and describe all the processes of making
oxygen and hydrogen. Why should she not draw and explain
a refrigerator as well as an air-pump? Both are to be
explained on philosophical principles. When a schoolgirl,
in her chemistry, studies the reciprocal action of acids and
alkalies, what is there to hinder the teaching her its application
to the various processes of cooking where acids and
alkalies are employed? Why should she not be led to see
how effervescence and fermentation can be made to perform
their office in the preparation of light and digestible bread?
Why should she not be taught the chemical substances by
which food is often adulterated, and the test by which such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
adulterations are detected? Why should she not understand
the processes of confectionery, and know how to guard
against the deleterious or poisonous elements that are introduced
into children&rsquo;s sugar-plums and candies? Why,
when she learns the doctrine of mordants, the substances
by which different colors are set, should she not learn it
with some practical view to future life, so that she may know
how to set the color of a fading calico or restore the color
of a spotted one? Why, in short, when a girl has labored
through a profound chemical work, and listened to courses of
chemical lectures, should she come to domestic life, which
presents a constant series of chemical experiments and
changes, and go blindly along as without chart or compass,
unable to tell what will take out a stain, or what will
brighten a metal, what are common poisons and what their
antidotes, and not knowing enough of the laws of caloric to
understand how to warm a house, or of the laws of atmosphere
to know how to ventilate one? Why should the
preparation of food, that subtile art on which life, health,
cheerfulness, good temper, and good looks so largely depend,
forever be left in the hands of the illiterate and vulgar?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A benevolent gentleman has lately left a large fortune
for the founding of a university for women; and the object
is stated to be to give to women who have already acquired
a general education the means of acquiring a professional
one, to fit themselves for some employment by which they
may gain a livelihood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this institution the women are to be instructed in
bookkeeping, stenography, telegraphing, photographing,
drawing, modeling, and various other arts; but, so far as
I remember, there is no proposal to teach domestic economy
as at least <i>one</i> of woman&rsquo;s professions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should there not be a professor of domestic economy
in every large female school? Why should not this professor
give lectures, first on house planning and building, illustrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
by appropriate apparatus? Why should not the pupils
have presented to their inspection models of houses planned
with reference to economy, to ease of domestic service, to
warmth, to ventilation, and to architectural appearance?
Why should not the professor go on to lecture further on
house-fixtures, with models of the best mangles, washing-machines,
clothes-wringers, ranges, furnaces, and cooking-stoves,
together with drawings and apparatus illustrative of
domestic hydraulics, showing the best contrivances for bathing-rooms
and the obvious principles of plumbing, so that
the pupils may have some idea how to work the machinery
of a convenient house when they have it, and to have such
conveniences introduced when wanting? If it is thought
worth while to provide at great expense apparatus for teaching
the revolutions of Saturn&rsquo;s moons and the precession of
the equinoxes, why should there not be some also to teach
what it may greatly concern a woman&rsquo;s earthly happiness
to know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should not the professor lecture on home chemistry,
devoting his first lecture to bread-making? and why
might not a batch of bread be made and baked and exhibited
to the class, together with specimens of morbid
anatomy in the bread line,&mdash;the sour cotton bread of the
baker; the rough, big-holed bread; the heavy, fossil bread;
the bitter bread of too much yeast,&mdash;and the causes of their
defects pointed out? And so with regard to the various
articles of food,&mdash;why might not chemical lectures be
given on all of them, one after another? In short, it
would be easy to trace out a course of lectures on common
things to occupy a whole year, and for which the pupils,
whenever they come to have homes of their own, will thank
the lecturer to the last day of their life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is no impossibility in teaching needlework,
the cutting and fitting of dresses, in female schools. The
thing is done very perfectly in English schools for the working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
classes. A girl trained at one of these schools came into
a family I once knew. She brought with her a sewing-book,
in which the process of making various articles was exhibited
in miniature. The several parts of a shirt were first shown,
each perfectly made, and fastened to a leaf of the book by
itself, and then the successive steps of uniting the parts, till
finally appeared a miniature model of the whole. The sewing
was done with red thread, so that every stitch might
show, and any imperfections be at once remedied. The same
process was pursued with regard to other garments, and a
good general idea of cutting and fitting them was thus given
to an entire class of girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same manner the care and nursing of young
children and the tending of the sick might be made the subject
of lectures. Every woman ought to have some general
principles to guide her with regard to what is to be done in
case of the various accidents that may befall either children
or grown people, and of their lesser illnesses, and ought to
know how to prepare comforts and nourishment for the sick.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s satirical remarks upon the contrast between the
elegant Zenobia&rsquo;s conversation, and the smoky porridge she
made for him when he was an invalid, might apply to the
volunteer cookery of many charming women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;that your Professor of Domestic
Economy would find enough to occupy his pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;were domestic economy properly honored
and properly taught, in the manner described, it would
open a sphere of employment to so many women in the home
life, that we should not be obliged to send our women out
to California or the Pacific to put an end to an anxious and
aimless life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When domestic work is sufficiently honored to be taught
as an art and science in our boarding-schools and high-schools,
then possibly it may acquire also dignity in the eyes of our
working classes, and young girls who have to earn their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
own living may no longer feel degraded in engaging in domestic
service. The place of a domestic in a family may
become as respectable in their eyes as a place in a factory,
in a printing-office, in a dressmaking or millinery establishment,
or behind the counter of a shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America there is no class which will confess itself
the lower class, and a thing recommended solely for the
benefit of any such class finds no one to receive it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the intelligent and cultivated look down on household
work with disdain; if they consider it as degrading, a
thing to be shunned by every possible device,&mdash;they may
depend upon it that the influence of such contempt of
woman&rsquo;s noble duties will flow downward, producing a like
contempt in every class in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our sovereign princesses learn the doctrine of equality
very quickly, and are not going to sacrifice themselves to
what is not considered <i>de bon ton</i> by the upper classes;
and the girl with the laced hat and parasol, without underclothes,
who does her best to &lsquo;shirk&rsquo; her duties as housemaid,
and is looking for marriage as an escape from work, is
a fair copy of her mistress, who married for much the same
reason, who hates housekeeping, and would rather board or
do anything else than have the care of a family. The one
is about as respectable as the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When housekeeping becomes an enthusiasm, and its
study and practice a fashion, then we shall have in America
that class of persons to rely on for help in household labors
who are now going to factories, to printing-offices, to every
kind of toil, forgetful of the best life and sphere of woman.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>III <br /><br />A FAMILY TALK ON RECONSTRUCTION</h3>
</div>
<p>Our Chimney-Corner, of which we have spoken somewhat,
has, besides the wonted domestic circle, its habitués
who have a frequent seat there. Among these, none is
more welcome than Theophilus Thoro.</p>
<p>Friend Theophilus was born on the shady side of Nature,
and endowed by his patron saint with every grace and gift
which can make a human creature worthy and available,
except the gift of seeing the bright side of things. His
bead-roll of Christian virtues includes all the graces of the
spirit except hope; and so, if one wants to know exactly
the flaw, the defect, the doubtful side, and to take into
account all the untoward possibilities of any person, place,
or thing, he had best apply to friend Theophilus. He can
tell you just where and how the best-laid scheme is likely
to fail, just the screw that will fall loose in the smoothest-working
machinery, just the flaw in the most perfect character,
just the defect in the best-written book, just the variety
of thorn that must accompany each particular species of
rose.</p>
<p>Yet Theophilus is without guile or malice. His want
of faith in human nature is not bitter and censorious, but
melting and pitiful. &ldquo;We are all poor trash, miserable
dogs together,&rdquo; he seems to say, as he looks out on the
world and its ways. There is not much to be expected of
or for any of us; but let us love one another and be patient.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Theophilus is one of the most incessant
workers for human good, and perseveringly busy in every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
scheme of benevolent enterprise, in all which he labors with
melancholy steadiness without hope. In religion he has
the soul of a martyr,&mdash;nothing would suit him better than
to be burned alive for his faith; but his belief in the success
of Christianity is about on a par with that of the
melancholy disciple of old, who, when Christ would go to
Jud&aelig;a, could only say, &ldquo;Let us also go, that we may die
with him.&rdquo; Theophilus is always ready to die for the truth
and the right, for which he never sees anything but defeat
and destruction ahead.</p>
<p>During the late war, Theophilus has been a despairing
patriot, dying daily, and giving all up for lost in every reverse
from Bull Run to Fredericksburg. The surrender of
Richmond and the capitulation of Lee shortened his visage
somewhat; but the murder of the President soon brought
it back to its old length. It is true that, while Lincoln
lived, he was in a perpetual state of dissent from all his
measures. He had broken his heart for years over the
miseries of the slaves, but he shuddered at the Emancipation
Proclamation; a whirlwind of anarchy was about to sweep
over the country, in which the black and the white would
dash against each other, and be shivered like potters&rsquo; vessels.
He was in despair at the accession of Johnson, believing
the worst of the unfavorable reports that clouded his reputation.
Nevertheless he was among the first of loyal citizens
to rally to the support of the new administration, because,
though he had no hope in that, he could see nothing
better.</p>
<p>You must not infer from all this that friend Theophilus
is a social wet blanket, a goblin shadow at the domestic
hearth. By no means. Nature has gifted him with that
vein of humor and that impulse to friendly joviality which
are frequent developments in sad-natured men, and often
deceive superficial observers as to their real character. He
who laughs well and makes you laugh is often called a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of cheerful disposition, yet in many cases nothing can be
further from it than precisely this kind of person.</p>
<p>Theophilus frequents our chimney-corner, perhaps because
Mrs. Crowfield and myself are, so to speak, children
of the light and the day. My wife has precisely the opposite
talent to that of our friend. She can discover the
good point, the sound spot, where others see only defect
and corruption. I myself am somewhat sanguine, and prone
rather to expect good than evil, and with a vast stock of
faith in the excellent things that may turn up in the future.
The millennium is one of the prime articles of my creed;
and all the ups and downs of society I regard only as so
many jolts on a very rough road that is taking the world
on, through many upsets and disasters, to that final consummation.</p>
<p>Theophilus holds the same belief theoretically; but it is
apt to sink so far out of sight in the mire of present disaster
as to be of very little comfort to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are going to ruin, in my view, about
as fast as we can go. Miss Jenny, I will trouble you for
another small lump of sugar in my tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been saying that, about our going to ruin,
every time you have taken tea here for four years past,&rdquo;
said Jenny; &ldquo;but I always noticed that your fears never
spoiled your relish either for tea or muffins. People talk
about being on the brink of a volcano, and the country
going to destruction, and all that, just as they put pepper on
their potatoes; it is an agreeable stimulant in conversation,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I can speak in another
vein. When had we ever in all our history so bright prospects,
so much to be thankful for? Slavery is abolished;
the last stain of disgrace is wiped from our national honor.
We stand now before the world self-consistent with our
principles. We have come out of one of the severest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
struggles that ever tried a nation, purer and stronger in
morals and religion, as well as more prosperous in material
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear madam, excuse me,&rdquo; said Theophilus; &ldquo;but
I cannot help being reminded of what an English reviewer
once said,&mdash;that a lady&rsquo;s facts have as much poetry in them
as Tom Moore&rsquo;s lyrics. Of course poetry is always <ins title="Was agreeble">agreeable</ins>,
even though of no statistical value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no poetry in my facts,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowfield. &ldquo;Is
not slavery forever abolished, by the confession of its best
friends,&mdash;even of those who declare its abolition a misfortune,
and themselves ruined in consequence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, my dear madam, that we have succeeded, as
we human creatures commonly do, in supposing that we
have destroyed an evil, when we have only changed its
name. We have contrived to withdraw from the slave just
that fiction of property relation which made it for the interest
of some one to care for him a little, however imperfectly;
and, having destroyed that, we turn him out defenseless to
shift for himself in a community every member of which is
embittered against him. The whole South resounds with
the outcries of slaves suffering the vindictive wrath of former
masters; laws are being passed hunting them out of
this State and out of that; the animosity of race&mdash;at all
times the most bitter and unreasonable of animosities&mdash;is
being aroused all over the land. And the free States take
the lead in injustice to them. Witness a late vote of Connecticut
on the suffrage question. The efforts of government
to protect the rights of these poor defenseless creatures
are about as energetic as such efforts always have been and
always will be while human nature remains what it is. For
a while the obvious rights of the weaker party will be confessed,
with some show of consideration, in public speeches;
they will be paraded by philanthropic sentimentalists, to
give point to their eloquence; they will be here and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
sustained in governmental measures, when there is no strong
temptation to the contrary, and nothing better to be done;
but the moment that political combinations begin to be
formed, all the rights and interests of this helpless people
will be bandied about as so many make-weights in the political
scale. Any troublesome lion will have a negro thrown
to him to keep him quiet. All their hopes will be dashed
to the ground by the imperious Southern white, no longer
feeling for them even the interest of a master, and regarding
them with a mixture of hatred and loathing as the
cause of all his reverses. Then if, driven to despair, they
seek to defend themselves by force, they will be crushed by
the power of the government and ground to powder, as the
weak have always been under the heel of the strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for our abolition of slavery. As to our material
prosperity, it consists of an inflated paper currency, an
immense debt, a giddy, foolhardy spirit of speculation and
stock-gambling, and a perfect furor of extravagance, which
is driving everybody to live beyond his means, and casting
contempt on the republican virtues of simplicity and
economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to advancement in morals, there never was so much
intemperance in our people before, and the papers are full
of accounts of frauds, defalcations, forgeries, robberies,
assassinations, and arsons. Against this tide of corruption
the various organized denominations of religion do nothing
effectual. They are an army shut up within their own intrenchments,
holding their own with difficulty, and in no
situation to turn back the furious assaults of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;according to your showing,
the whole country is going to destruction. Now, if things
really are so bad, if you really believe all you have been
saying, you ought not to be sitting drinking your tea as you
are now, or to have spent the afternoon playing croquet
with us girls; you ought to gird yourself with sackcloth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and go up and down the land, raising the alarm, and saying,
&lsquo;Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Theophilus, while a covert smile played
about his lips, &ldquo;you know the saying, &lsquo;Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow,&rsquo; etc. Things are not yet gone to destruction,
only going,&mdash;and why not have a good time on
deck before the ship goes to pieces? Your chimney-corner
is a tranquil island in the ocean of trouble, and your muffins
are absolutely perfect. I&rsquo;ll take another, if you&rsquo;ll please
to pass them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind not to pass them,&rdquo; said Jenny.
&ldquo;Are you in earnest in what you are saying, or are you
only saying it for sensation? How can people believe such
things and be comfortable? I could not. If I believed all
you have been saying I could not sleep nights,&mdash;I should
be perfectly miserable; and <i>you</i> cannot really believe all
this, or you would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowfield, &ldquo;our friend&rsquo;s
picture is the truth painted with all its shadows and none
of its lights. All the dangers he speaks of are real and
great, but he omits the counterbalancing good. Let <i>me</i>
speak now. There never has been a time in our history
when so many honest and just men held power in our land
as now,&mdash;never a government before in which the public
councils recognized with more respect the just and the right.
There never was an instance of a powerful government showing
more tenderness in the protection of a weak and defenseless
race than ours has shown in the care of the freedmen
hitherto. There never was a case in which the people
of a country were more willing to give money and time and
disinterested labor to raise and educate those who have thus
been thrown on their care. Considering that we have had
a great, harassing, and expensive war on our hands, I think
the amount done by government and individuals for the
freedmen unequaled in the history of nations; and I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
not know why it should be predicted from this past fact
that, in the future, both government and people are about
to throw them to the lions, as Mr. Theophilus supposes.
Let us wait, at least, and see. So long as government
maintains a freedmen&rsquo;s bureau, administered by men of such
high moral character, we must think, at all events, that
there are strong indications in the right direction. Just
think of the immense advance of public opinion within four
years, and of the grand successive steps of this advance,&mdash;Emancipation
in the District of Columbia, the Repeal of the
Fugitive Slave Law, the General Emancipation Act, the
Amendment of the Constitution. All these do not look as
if the black were about to be ground to powder beneath the
heel of the white. If the negroes are oppressed in the
South, they can emigrate; no laws hold them; active, industrious
laborers will soon find openings in any part of the
Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Theophilus, &ldquo;there will be black laws like
those of Illinois and Tennessee; there will be turbulent
uprisings of the Irish, excited by political demagogues, that
will bar them out of Northern States. Besides, as a class,
they <i>will</i> be idle and worthless. It will not be their fault,
but it will be the result of their slave education. All their
past observation of their masters has taught them that liberty
means licensed laziness, that work means degradation;
and therefore they will loathe work, and cherish laziness
as the sign of liberty. &lsquo;Am not I free? Have I not as
good a right to do nothing as you?&rsquo; will be the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already the lazy whites, who never lifted a hand in
any useful employment, begin to raise the cry that &lsquo;niggers
won&rsquo;t work;&rsquo; and I suspect the cry may not be without
reason. Industrious citizens can never be made in a community
where the higher class think useful labor a disgrace.
The whites will oppose the negro in every effort to rise;
they will debar him of every civil and social right; they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
will set him the worst possible example, as they have been
doing for hundreds of years; and then they will hound and
hiss at him for being what they made him. This is the old
track of the world,&mdash;the good, broad, reputable road on
which all aristocracies and privileged classes have been always
traveling; and it&rsquo;s not likely that we shall have much
of a secession from it. The millennium isn&rsquo;t so near us as
that, by a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well arguing from human selfishness and
human sin in that way,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t take up a
newspaper that doesn&rsquo;t contain abundant facts to the contrary.
Here, now,&rdquo;&mdash;and I turned to the &ldquo;Tribune,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;is
one item that fell under my eye accidentally, as you
were speaking:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Superintendent of Freedmen&rsquo;s Affairs in Louisiana,
in making up his last Annual Report, says he has 1,952
blacks settled temporarily on 9,650 acres of land, who last
year raised crops to the value of $175,000, and that he
had but few worthless blacks under his care; and that, as
a class, the blacks have fewer vagrants than can be found
among any other class of persons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such testimonies gem the newspapers like stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newspapers of your way of thinking, very likely,&rdquo; said
Theophilus; &ldquo;but if it comes to statistics, I can bring
counter-statements, numerous and dire, from scores of
Southern papers, of vagrancy, laziness, improvidence, and
wretchedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably both are true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;according to the
greater or less care which has been taken of the blacks in
different regions. Left to themselves, they tend downward,
pressed down by the whole weight of semi-barbarous white
society; but when the free North protects and guides, the
results are as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think the free North has salt enough in it
to save this whole Southern mass from corruption? I wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
I could think so; but all I can see in the free North at
present is a raging, tearing, headlong chase after <i>money</i>.
Now money is of significance only as it gives people the
power of expressing their ideal of life. And what does
this ideal prove to be among us? Is it not to ape all the
splendors and vices of old aristocratic society? Is it not to
be able to live in idleness, without useful employment, a
life of glitter and flutter and show? What do our New
York dames of fashion seek after? To avoid family care,
to find servants at any price who will relieve them of home
responsibilities, and take charge of their houses and children
while they shine at ball and opera, and drive in the park.
And the servants who learn of these mistresses,&mdash;what do
they seek after? <i>They</i> seek also to get rid of care, to live
as nearly as possible without work, to dress and shine in
their secondary sphere, as the mistresses do in the primary
one. High wages with little work and plenty of company
express Biddy&rsquo;s ideal of life, which is a little more respectable
than that of her mistress, who wants high wages with
no work. The house and the children are not Biddy&rsquo;s; and
why should she care more for their well-being than the
mistress and the mother?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence come wranglings and moanings. Biddy uses
a chest of tea in three months, and the amount of the
butcher&rsquo;s bill is fabulous; Jane gives the baby laudanum
to quiet it, while she slips out to <i>her</i> parties; and the
upper classes are shocked at the demoralized state of the
Irish, their utter want of faithfulness and moral principle!
How dreadful that there are no people who enjoy the self-denials
and the cares which they dislike, that there are no
people who rejoice in carrying that burden of duties which
they do not wish to touch with one of their fingers! The
outcry about the badness of servants means just this: that
everybody is tired of self-helpfulness,&mdash;the servants as
thoroughly as the masters and mistresses. All want the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
cream of life, without even the trouble of skimming; and
the great fight now is, who shall drink the skim-milk, which
nobody wants. <i>Work</i>,&mdash;honorable toil,&mdash;manly, womanly
endeavor,&mdash;is just what nobody likes; and this is as much
a fact in the free North as in the slave South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are all the young girls looking for in marriage?
Some man with money enough to save them from taking
any care or having any trouble in domestic life, enabling
them, like the lilies of the field, to rival Solomon in all
his glory, while they toil not, neither do they spin; and
when they find that even money cannot purchase freedom
from care in family life, because their servants are exactly
of the same mind with themselves, and hate to do their
duties as cordially as they themselves do, then are they
in anguish of spirit, and wish for slavery, or aristocracy,
or anything that would give them power over the lower
classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Mr. Theophilus,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;there is no
sin in disliking trouble, and wanting to live easily and
have a good time in one&rsquo;s life,&mdash;it&rsquo;s so very natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sin, my dear, I admit; but there is a certain amount
of work and trouble that somebody must take to carry on
the family and the world; and the mischief is, that all are
agreed in wanting to get rid of it. Human nature is above
all things lazy. I am lazy myself. Everybody is. The
whole struggle of society is as to who shall eat the hard
bread-and-cheese of labor, which must be eaten by somebody.
Nobody wants it,&mdash;neither you in the parlor, nor
Biddy in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The mass ought to labor, and we lie on sofas,&rsquo; is a sentence
that would unite more subscribers than any confession
of faith that ever was presented, whether religious or political;
and its subscribers would be as numerous and sincere
in the free States as in the slave States, or I am much
mistaken in my judgment. The negroes are men and women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
like any of the rest of us, and particularly apt in the
imitation of the ways and ideas current in good society;
and consequently to learn to play on the piano and to have
nothing in particular to do will be the goal of aspiration
among colored girls and woman, and to do housework will
seem to them intolerable drudgery, simply because it is so
among the fair models to whom they look up in humble
admiration. You see, my dear, what it is to live in a democracy.
It deprives us of the vantage-ground on which
we cultivated people can stand and say to our neighbor,&mdash;&lsquo;The
cream is for me, and the skim-milk for you; the
white bread for me, and the brown for you. I am born
to amuse myself and have a good time, and you are born
to do everything that is tiresome and disagreeable to me.&rsquo;
The &lsquo;My Lady Ludlows&rsquo; of the Old World can stand on
their platform and lecture the lower classes from the Church
Catechism, to &lsquo;order themselves lowly and reverently to all
their betters;&rsquo; and they can base their exhortations on the
old established law of society by which some are born to
inherit the earth, and live a life of ease and pleasure, and
others to toil without pleasure or amusement, for their
support and aggrandizement. An aristocracy, as I take it,
is a combination of human beings to divide life into two
parts, one of which shall comprise all social and moral advantages,
refinement, elegance, leisure, ease, pleasure, and
amusement,&mdash;and the other, incessant toil, with the absence
of every privilege and blessing of human existence.
Life thus divided, we aristocrats keep the good for ourselves
and our children, and distribute the evil as the lot
of the general mass of mankind. The desire to monopolize
and to dominate is the most rooted form of human
selfishness; it is the hydra with many heads, and, cut off
in one place, it puts out in another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nominally, the great aristocratic arrangement of American
society has just been destroyed; but really, I take it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
the essential <i>animus</i> of the slave system still exists, and
pervades the community, North as well as South. Everybody
is wanting to get the work done by somebody else,
and to take the money himself; the grinding between employers
and employed is going on all the time, and the field
of controversy has only been made wider by bringing in a
whole new class of laborers. The Irish have now the opportunity
to sustain their aristocracy over the negro. Shall
they not have somebody to look down upon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All through free society, employers and employed are
at incessant feud; and the more free and enlightened the
society, the more bitter the feud. The standing complaint
of life in America is the badness of servants; and England,
which always follows at a certain rate behind us in our
social movements, is beginning to raise very loudly the same
complaint. The condition of service has been thought
worthy of public attention in some of the leading British
prints; and Ruskin, in a summing-up article, speaks of it
as a deep ulcer in society,&mdash;a thing hopeless of remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Theophilus,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I cannot
imagine whither you are rambling, or to what purpose you
are getting up these horrible shadows. You talk of the
world as if there were no God in it, overruling the selfishness
of men, and educating it up to order and justice. I do
not deny that there is a vast deal of truth in what you say.
Nobody doubts that, in general, human nature <i>is</i> selfish,
callous, unfeeling, willing to engross all good to itself, and
to trample on the rights of others. Nevertheless, thanks
to God&rsquo;s teaching and fatherly care, the world has worked
along to the point of a great nation founded on the principles
of strict equality, forbidding all monopolies, aristocracies,
privileged classes, by its very constitution; and now, by
God&rsquo;s wonderful providence, this nation has been brought,
and forced, as it were, to overturn and abolish the only
aristocratic institution that interfered with its free development.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
Does not this look as if a Mightier Power than ours
were working in and for us, supplementing our weakness
and infirmity? and if we believe that man is always ready
to drop everything and let it run back to evil, shall we not
have faith that God will <i>not</i> drop the noble work he has so
evidently taken in hand in this nation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want to know,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;why your illustrations
of selfishness are all drawn from the female sex. Why
do you speak of girls that marry for money, any more than
men? of mistresses of families that want to be free from
household duties and responsibilities, rather than of masters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My charming young lady,&rdquo; said Theophilus, &ldquo;it is a
fact that in America, except the slaveholders, women have
hitherto been the only aristocracy. Women have been the
privileged class,&mdash;the only one to which our rough democracy
has always and everywhere given the precedence,&mdash;and
consequently the vices of aristocrats are more developed
in them as a class than among men. The leading principle
of aristocracy, which is to take pay without work, to live
on the toils and earnings of others, is one which obtains
more generally among women than among men in this
country. The men of our country, as a general thing, even
in our uppermost classes, always propose to themselves some
work or business by which they may acquire a fortune, or
enlarge that already made for them by their fathers. The
women of the same class propose to themselves nothing but
to live at their ease on the money made for them by the
labors of fathers and husbands. As a consequence, they
become enervated and indolent,&mdash;averse to any bracing,
wholesome effort, either mental or physical. The unavoidable
responsibilities and cares of a family, instead of being
viewed by them in the light of a noble life work, in which
they do their part in the general labors of the world, seem
to them so many injuries and wrongs; they seek to turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
them upon servants, and find servants unwilling to take
them; and so selfish are they, that I have heard more than
one lady declare that she didn&rsquo;t care if it was unjust, she
should like to have slaves, rather than be plagued with servants
who had so much liberty. All the novels, poetry,
and light literature of the world, which form the general
staple of female reading, are based upon aristocratic institutions,
and impregnated with aristocratic ideas; and women
among us are constantly aspiring to foreign and aristocratic
modes of life rather than to those of native republican simplicity.
How many women are there, think you, that would
not go in for aristocracy and aristocratic prerogatives, if they
were only sure that they themselves should be of the privileged
class? To be &lsquo;My Lady Duchess,&rsquo; and to have a
right by that simple title to the prostrate deference of all
the lower orders! How many would have firmness to vote
against such an establishment merely because it was bad
for society? Tell the fair Mrs. Feathercap, &lsquo;In order that
you may be a duchess, and have everything a paradise of
elegance and luxury around you and your children, a hundred
poor families must have no chance for anything better
than black bread and muddy water all their lives, a hundred
poor men must work all their lives on such wages that a
fortnight&rsquo;s sickness will send their families to the almshouse,
and that no amount of honesty and forethought can lay up
any provision for old age.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, sir,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me that there
are any girls or women so mean and selfish as to want aristocracy
or rank so purchased! You are too bad, Mr. Theophilus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they might not, were it stated in just these
terms; yet I think, if the question of the establishment of
an order of aristocracy among us were put to vote, we should
find more women than men who would go for it; and they
would flout at the consequences to society with the lively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
wit and the musical laugh which make feminine selfishness
so genteel and agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It is a fact that in America, the women, in the
wealthy classes, are like the noblemen of aristocracies, and
the men are the workers. And in all this outcry that has
been raised about women&rsquo;s wages being inferior to those
of men there is one thing overlooked,&mdash;and that is, that
women&rsquo;s work is generally inferior to that of men, because
in every rank they are the pets of society and are excused
from the laborious drill and training by which men are fitted
for their callings. Our fair friends come in generally by
some royal road to knowledge, which saves them the dire necessity
of real work,&mdash;a sort of feminine hop-skip-and-jump
into science or mechanical skill,&mdash;nothing like the uncompromising
hard labor to which the boy is put who would be
a mechanic or farmer, a lawyer or physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit freely that we men are to blame for most of
the faults of our fair nobility. There is plenty of heroism,
abundance of energy, and love of noble endeavor lying dormant
in these sheltered and petted daughters of the better
classes; but we keep it down and smother it. Fathers and
brothers think it discreditable to themselves not to give
their daughters and sisters the means of living in idleness;
and any adventurous fair one, who seeks to end the ennui of
utter aimlessness by applying herself to some occupation
whereby she may earn her own living, infallibly draws down
on her the comments of her whole circle: &lsquo;Keeping school,
is she? Isn&rsquo;t her father rich enough to support her?
What could possess her?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, my dear Sir Oracle, that you are beginning
to recollect yourself and temper your severities on our sex,&rdquo;
said my wife. &ldquo;As usual, there is much truth lying about
loosely in the vicinity of your assertions; but they are as
far from being in themselves the truth as would be their
exact opposites.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The class of American women who travel, live abroad,
and represent our country to the foreign eye, have acquired
the reputation of being Sybarites in luxury and extravagance,
and there is much in the modes of life that are creeping
into our richer circles to justify this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Murray, ex-maid-of-honor to the Queen of England,
among other impressions which she received from an
extended tour through our country, states it as her conviction
that young American girls of the better classes are less
helpful in nursing the sick and in the general duties of
family life than the daughters of the aristocracy of England;
and I am inclined to believe it, because even the Queen has
taken special pains to cultivate habits of energy and self-helpfulness
in her children. One of the toys of the
Princess Royal was said to be a cottage of her own, furnished
with every accommodation for cooking and housekeeping,
where she from time to time enacted the part of housekeeper,
making bread and biscuit, boiling potatoes which
she herself had gathered from her own garden-patch, and
inviting her royal parents to meals of her own preparing;
and report says, that the dignitaries of the German court
have been horrified at the energetic determination of the
young royal housekeeper to overlook her own linen closets
and attend to her own affairs. But as an offset to what I
have been saying, it must be admitted that America is a
country where a young woman can be self-supporting without
forfeiting her place in society. All our New England
and Western towns show us female teachers who are as well
received and as much caressed in society, and as often contract
advantageous marriages, as any women whatever; and
the productive labor of American women, in various arts,
trades, and callings, would be found, I think, not inferior
to that of any women in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, the history of the late war has shown
them capable of every form of heroic endeavor. We have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
had hundreds of Florence Nightingales, and an amount of
real hard work has been done by female hands not inferior
to that performed by men in the camp and field, and enough
to make sure that American womanhood is not yet so enervated
as seriously to interfere with the prospects of free
republican society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;what it is in our country
that spoils the working classes that come into it. They say
that the emigrants, as they land here, are often simple-hearted
people, willing to work, accustomed to early hours
and plain living, decorous and respectful in their manners.
It would seem as if aristocratic drilling had done them
good. In a few months they become brawling, impertinent,
grasping, want high wages, and are very unwilling to work.
I went to several intelligence-offices the other day to look
for a girl for Marianne, and I thought, by the way the candidates
catechized the ladies, and the airs they took upon
them, that they considered themselves the future mistresses
interrogating their subordinates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Does ye expect me to do the washin&rsquo; with the cookin&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thin I&rsquo;ll niver go to that place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And does ye expect me to get the early breakfast for
yer husband to be off in the train every mornin&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I niver does that,&mdash;that ought to be a second girl&rsquo;s
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many servants does ye keep, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I niver lives with people that keeps but two servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many has ye in yer family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too large a family. Has ye much company?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, we have company occasionally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thin I can&rsquo;t come to ye; it&rsquo;ll be too harrd a place.&rsquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, the thing they were all in quest of seemed to
be a very small family, with very high wages, and many
perquisites and privileges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the kind of work-people our manners and institutions
make of people that come over here. I remember
one day seeing a coachman touch his cap to his mistress
when she spoke to him, as is the way in Europe, and hearing
one or two others saying among themselves,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That chap&rsquo;s a greenie; he&rsquo;ll get over that soon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these things show,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the staff of power
has passed from the hands of gentility into those of labor.
We may think the working classes somewhat unseemly in
their assertion of self-importance; but, after all, are they,
considering their inferior advantages of breeding, any more
overbearing and impertinent than the upper classes have
always been to them in all ages and countries?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Biddy looks long, hedges in her work with many
conditions, and is careful to get the most she can for the
least labor, is she, after all, doing any more than you or I
or all the rest of the world? I myself will not write articles
for five dollars a page, when there are those who will
give me fifteen. I would not do double duty as an editor
on a salary of seven thousand, when I could get ten thousand
for less work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy and her mistress are two human beings, with
the same human wants. Both want to escape trouble, to
make their life comfortable and easy, with the least outlay
of expense. Biddy&rsquo;s capital is her muscles and sinews; and
she wants to get as many greenbacks in exchange for them
as her wit and shrewdness will enable her to do. You feel,
when you bargain with her, that she is nothing to you, except
so far as her strength and knowledge may save you
care and trouble; and she feels that you are nothing to
her, except so far as she can get your money for her work.
The free-and-easy airs of those seeking employment show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
one thing,&mdash;that the country in general is prosperous, and
that openings for profitable employment are so numerous
that it is not thought necessary to try to conciliate favor.
If the community were at starvation-point, and the loss of
a situation brought fear of the almshouse, the laboring-class
would be more subservient. As it is, there is a little spice
of the bitterness of a past age of servitude in their present
attitude,&mdash;a bristling, self-defensive impertinence, which
will gradually smooth away as society learns to accommodate
itself to the new order of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, papa,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think all
this a very severe test, if applied to us women particularly,
more than to the men? Mr. Theophilus seems to think
women are aristocrats, and go for enslaving the lower classes
out of mere selfishness; but I say that we are a great deal
more strongly tempted than men, because all these annoyances
and trials of domestic life come upon us. It is very
insidious, the aristocratic argument, as it appeals to us;
there seems much to be said in its favor. It does appear
to me that it is better to have servants and work-people
tidy, industrious, respectful, and decorous, as they are in
Europe, than domineering, impertinent, and negligent, as
they are here,&mdash;and it seems that there is something in
our institutions that produces these disagreeable traits; and
I presume that the negroes will eventually be traveling the
same road as the Irish, and from the same influences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people see all these things, and feel all the inconveniences
of them, I don&rsquo;t wonder that they are tempted
not to like democracy, and to feel as if aristocratic institutions
made a more agreeable state of society. It is not such
a blank, bald, downright piece of brutal selfishness as Mr.
Theophilus there seems to suppose, for us to wish there
were some quiet, submissive, laborious lower class, who
would be content to work for kind treatment and moderate
wages.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my little dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the matter is not left to
our choice. Wish it or not wish it, it&rsquo;s what we evidently
can&rsquo;t have. The day for that thing is past. The power is
passing out of the hands of the cultivated few into those of
the strong, laborious many. <i>Numbers</i> is the king of our
era; and he will reign over us, whether we will hear or
whether we will forbear. The sighers for an obedient lower
class and the mourners for slavery may get ready their crape
and have their pocket-handkerchiefs bordered with black;
for they have much weeping to do, and for many years to
come. The good old feudal times, when two thirds of the
population thought themselves born only for the honor,
glory, and profit of the other third, are gone, with all their
beautiful devotions, all their trappings of song and story.
In the land where such institutions were most deeply rooted
and most firmly established, they are assailed every day by
hard hands and stout hearts; and their position resembles
that of some of the picturesque ruins of Italy, which are
constantly being torn away to build prosaic modern shops
and houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This great democratic movement is coming down into
modern society with a march as irresistible as the glacier
moves down from the mountains. Its front is in America,&mdash;and
behind are England, France, Italy, Prussia, and the
Mohammedan countries. In all, the rights of the laboring
masses are a living force, bearing slowly and inevitably all
before it. Our war has been a marshaling of its armies,
commanded by a hard-handed, inspired man of the working-class.
An intelligent American, recently resident in Egypt,
says it was affecting to notice the interest with which the
working classes there were looking upon our late struggle in
America, and the earnestness of their wishes for the triumph
of the Union. &lsquo;It is our cause, it is for us,&rsquo; they
said, as said the cotton spinners of England and the silk
weavers of Lyons. The forces of this mighty movement are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
still directed by a man from the lower orders, the sworn foe
of exclusive privileges and landed aristocracies. If Andy
Johnson is consistent with himself, with the principles
which raised him from a tailor&rsquo;s bench to the head of a
mighty nation, he will see to it that the work that Lincoln
began is so thoroughly done, that every man and every
woman in America, of whatever race or complexion, shall
have exactly equal rights before the law, and be free to rise
or fall according to their individual intelligence, industry,
and moral worth. So long as everything is not strictly
in accordance with our principles of democracy, so long as
there is in any part of the country an aristocratic upper
class who despise labor, and a laboring lower class that is
denied equal political rights, so long this grinding and discord
between the two will never cease in America. It will
make trouble not only in the South, but in the North,&mdash;trouble
between all employers and employed,&mdash;trouble in
every branch and department of labor,&mdash;trouble in every
parlor and every kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that has driven every American woman out
of domestic service, when domestic service is full as well
paid, is easier, healthier, and in many cases far more agreeable,
than shop and factory work? It is, more than anything
else, the influence of slavery in the South,&mdash;its insensible
influence on the minds of mistresses, giving them
false ideas of what ought to be the position and treatment
of a female citizen in domestic service, and its very marked
influence on the minds of freedom-loving Americans, causing
them to choose <i>any</i> position rather than one which is regarded
as assimilating them to slaves. It is difficult to say
what are the very worst results of a system so altogether
bad as that of slavery; but one of the worst is certainly the
utter contempt it brings on useful labor, and the consequent
utter physical and moral degradation of a large body of the
whites; and this contempt of useful labor has been constantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
spreading like an infection from the Southern to the
Northern States, particularly among women, who, as our
friend here has truly said, are by our worship and exaltation
of them made peculiarly liable to take the malaria of
aristocratic society. Let anybody observe the conversation
in good society for an hour or two, and hear the tone in
which servant-girls, seamstresses, mechanics, and all who
work for their living, are sometimes mentioned, and he will
see that, while every one of the speakers professes to regard
useful labor as respectable, she is yet deeply imbued with
the leaven of aristocratic ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the South the contempt for labor bred of slavery
has so permeated society, that we see great, coarse, vulgar
<i>lazzaroni</i> lying about in rags and vermin, and dependent
on government rations, maintaining, as their only source of
self-respect, that they never have done and never will do a
stroke of useful work in all their lives. In the North there
are, I believe, no <i>men</i> who would make such a boast; but I
think there are many women&mdash;beautiful, fascinating <i>lazzaroni</i>
of the parlor and boudoir&mdash;who make their boast
of elegant helplessness and utter incompetence for any of
woman&rsquo;s duties with equal naïveté. The Spartans made
their slaves drunk, to teach their children the evils of intoxication;
and it seems to be the policy of a large class in the
South now to keep down and degrade the only working
class they have, for the sake of teaching their children to
despise work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We of the North, who know the dignity of labor, who
know the value of free and equal institutions, who have enjoyed
advantages for seeing their operation, ought, in true
brotherliness, to exercise the power given us by the present
position of the people of the Southern States, and put things
thoroughly right for them, well knowing, that, though they
may not like it at the moment, they will like it in the end,
and that it will bring them peace, plenty, and settled prosperity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
such as they have long envied here in the North. It
is no kindness to an invalid brother, half recovered from
delirium, to leave him a knife to cut his throat with, should
he be so disposed. We should rather appeal from Philip
drunk to Philip sober, and do real kindness, trusting to the
future for our meed of gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giving equal political rights to all the inhabitants of
the Southern States will be their shortest way to quiet and
to wealth. It will avert what is else almost certain,&mdash;a
war of races; since all experience shows that the ballot introduces
the very politest relations between the higher and
lower classes. If the right be restricted, let it be by requirements
of property and education, applying to all the population
equally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, we citizens and citizenesses of the North
should remember that Reconstruction means something more
than setting things right in the Southern States. We have
saved our government and institutions, but we have paid a
fearful price for their salvation; and we ought to prove now
that they are worth the price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The empty chair, never to be filled; the light gone out
on its candlestick, never on earth to be rekindled; gallant
souls that have exhaled to heaven in slow torture and starvation;
the precious blood that has drenched a hundred
battlefields,&mdash;all call to us with warning voices, and tell us
not to let such sacrifices be in vain. They call on us by
our clear understanding of the great principles of democratic
equality, for which our martyred brethren suffered and died,
to show to all the world that their death was no mean and
useless waste, but a glorious investment for the future of
mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This war, these sufferings, these sacrifices, ought to
make every American man and woman look on himself and
herself as belonging to a royal priesthood, a peculiar people.
The blood of our slain ought to be a gulf, wide and deep as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Atlantic, dividing us from the opinions and the practices of
countries whose government and society are founded on other
and antagonistic ideas. Democratic republicanism has never
yet been perfectly worked out either in this or any other
country. It is a splendid edifice, half built, deformed by
rude scaffolding, noisy with the clink of trowels, blinding
the eyes with the dust of lime, and endangering our heads
with falling brick. We make our way over heaps of shavings
and lumber to view the stately apartments,&mdash;we endanger
our necks in climbing ladders standing in the place
of future staircases; but let us not for all this cry out that
the old rat-holed mansions of former ages, with their mould,
and moss, and cockroaches, are better than this new palace.
There is no lime-dust, no clink of trowels, no rough scaffolding
there, to be sure, and life goes on very quietly; but there
is the foul air of slow and sure decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Republican institutions in America are in a transition
state; they have not yet separated themselves from foreign
and antagonistic ideas and traditions, derived from old countries;
and the labors necessary for the upbuilding of society
are not yet so adjusted that there is mutual pleasure and
comfort in the relations of employer and employed. We
still incline to class distinctions and aristocracies. We incline
to the scheme of dividing the world&rsquo;s work into two
orders: first, physical labor, which is held to be rude and
vulgar, and the province of a lower class; and second, brain
labor, held to be refined and aristocratic, and the province
of a higher class. Meanwhile, the Creator, who is the greatest
of levelers, has given to every human being both a
physical system, needing to be kept in order by physical
labor, and an intellectual or brain power, needing to be kept
in order by brain labor. Work, use, employment, is the
condition of health in both; and he who works either to
the neglect of the other lives but a half-life, and is an imperfect
human being.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The aristocracies of the Old World claim that their only
labor should be that of the brain; and they keep their physical
system in order by violent exercise, which is made genteel
from the fact only that it is not useful or productive.
It would be losing caste to refresh the muscles by handling
the plough or the axe; and so foxes and hares must be kept
to be hunted, and whole counties turned into preserves, in
order that the nobility and gentry may have physical exercise
in a way befitting their station,&mdash;that is to say, in
a way that produces nothing, and does good only to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The model republican uses his brain for the highest
purposes of brain work, and his muscles in productive physical
labor; and useful labor he respects above that which is
merely agreeable. When this equal respect for physical and
mental labor shall have taken possession of every American
citizen, there will be no so-called laboring class; there will
no more be a class all muscle without brain power to guide
it, and a class all brain without muscular power to execute.
The labors of society will be lighter, because each individual
will take his part in them; they will be performed better,
because no one will be overburdened. In those days, Miss
Jenny, it will be an easier matter to keep house, because,
housework being no longer regarded as degrading drudgery,
you will find a superior class of women ready to engage in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every young girl and woman, who in her sphere and
by her example shows that she is not ashamed of domestic
labor, and that she considers the necessary work and duties
of family life as dignified and important, is helping to bring
on this good day. Louis Philippe once jestingly remarked,
&lsquo;I have this qualification for being a king in these days,
that I have blacked my own boots, and could black them
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every American ought to cultivate, as his pride and
birthright, the habit of self-helpfulness. Our command of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
the labors of good employees in any department is liable to
such interruptions, that he who has blacked his own boots,
and can do it again, is, on the whole, likely to secure the
most comfort in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that which Mr. Ruskin pronounces to be a deep,
irremediable ulcer in society, namely, domestic service, we
hold that the last workings of pure democracy will cleanse
and heal it. When right ideas are sufficiently spread; when
everybody is self-helpful and capable of being self-supporting;
when there is a fair start for every human being in the
race of life, and all its prizes are, without respect of persons,
to be obtained by the best runner; when every kind of useful
labor is thoroughly respected,&mdash;then there will be a
clear, just, wholesome basis of intercourse on which employers
and employed can move without wrangling or discord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renouncing all claims to superiority on the one hand,
and all thought of servility on the other, service can be
rendered by fair contracts and agreements, with that mutual
respect and benevolence which every human being owes to
every other. But for this transition period, which is wearing
out the life of so many women, and making so many
households uncomfortable, I have some alleviating suggestions,
which I shall give in my next chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IV <br /><br />IS WOMAN A WORKER</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, do you see what the &lsquo;Evening Post&rsquo; says of your
New Year&rsquo;s article on Reconstruction?&rdquo; said Jenny, as we
were all sitting in the library after tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, the charming writer, whoever he is, takes
up for us girls and women, and maintains that no work of
any sort ought to be expected of us; that our only mission
in life is to be beautiful, and to refresh and elevate the
spirits of men by being so. If I get a husband, my mission
is to be always becomingly dressed, to display most captivating
toilettes, and to be always in good spirits,&mdash;as, under
the circumstances, I always should be,&mdash;and thus &lsquo;renew
his spirits&rsquo; when he comes in weary with the toils of life.
Household cares are to be far from me: they destroy my
cheerfulness and injure my beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that the New England standard of excellence
as applied to woman has been a mistaken one; and, in consequence,
though the girls are beautiful, the matrons are faded,
overworked, and uninteresting; and that such a state of society
tends to immorality, because, when wives are no longer
charming, men are open to the temptation to desert their
firesides, and get into mischief generally. He seems particularly
to complain of your calling ladies who do nothing the
&lsquo;fascinating <i>lazzaroni</i> of the parlor and boudoir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was too much truth back of that arrow not to
wound,&rdquo; said Theophilus Thoro, who was ensconced, as
usual, in his dark corner, whence he supervises our discussions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Thoro, we won&rsquo;t have any of your bitter
moralities,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;they are only to be taken as the
invariable bay-leaf which Professor Blot introduces into all
his recipes for soups and stews,&mdash;a little elegant bitterness,
to be kept tastefully in the background. You see now,
papa, I should like the vocation of being beautiful. It
would just suit me to wear point-lace and jewelry, and to
have life revolve round me, as some beautiful star, and feel
that I had nothing to do but shine and refresh the spirits
of all gazers, and that in this way I was truly useful, and
fulfilling the great end of my being; but alas for this doctrine!
all women have not beauty. The most of us can
only hope not to be called ill-looking, and, when we get
ourselves up with care, to look fresh and trim and agreeable;
which fact interferes with the theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said young Rudolph, &ldquo;I go for
the theory of the beautiful. If ever I marry, it is to find
an asylum for ideality. I don&rsquo;t want to make a culinary
marriage or a business partnership. I want a being whom
I can keep in a sphere of poetry and beauty, out of the
dust and grime of every-lay life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mr. Theophilus, &ldquo;you must either be a
rich man in your own right, or your fair ideal must have a
handsome fortune of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will marry a rich wife,&rdquo; quoth Rudolph.
&ldquo;My wife must be supported by me, not I by her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudolph is another of the habitués of our chimney-corner,
representing the order of young knighthood in America, and
his dreams and fancies, if impracticable, are always of a kind
to make every one think him a good fellow. He who has no
romantic dreams at twenty-one will be a horribly dry peascod
at fifty; therefore it is that I gaze reverently at all Rudolph&rsquo;s
chateaus in Spain, which want nothing to complete
them except solid earth to stand on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; said Theophilus, &ldquo;how long will it take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
a young lawyer or physician, starting with no heritage but
his own brain, to create a sphere of poetry and beauty in
which to keep his goddess? How much a year will be
necessary, as the English say, to <i>do</i> this garden of Eden,
whereinto shall enter only the poetry of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t seen it near enough to consider.
It is because I know the difficulty of its attainment
that I have no present thoughts of marriage. Marriage
is to me in the bluest of all blue distances,&mdash;far off,
mysterious, and dreamy as the Mountains of the Moon or
sources of the Nile. It shall come only when I have secured
a fortune that shall place my wife above all necessity of
work or care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire to hear from you,&rdquo; said Theophilus, &ldquo;when
you have found the sum that will keep a woman from care.
I know of women now inhabiting palaces, waited on at
every turn by servants, with carriages, horses, jewels, laces,
Cashmeres, enough for princesses, who are eaten up by care.
One lies awake all night on account of a wrinkle in the
waist of her dress; another is dying because no silk of a
certain inexpressible shade is to be found in New York; a
third has had a dress sent home, which has proved such a failure
that life seems no longer worth having. If it were not
for the consolations of religion, one doesn&rsquo;t know what would
become of her. The fact is, that care and labor are as
much correlated to human existence as shadow is to light;
there is no such thing as excluding them from any mortal
lot. You may make a canary-bird or a gold-fish live in
absolute contentment without a care or labor, but a human
being you cannot. Human beings are restless and active
in their very nature, and will do something, and that something
will prove a care, a labor, and a fatigue, arrange it
how you will. As long as there is anything to be desired
and not yet attained, so long its attainment will be attempted;
so long as that attainment is doubtful or difficult,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
so long will there be care and anxiety. When boundless
wealth releases woman from every family care, she immediately
makes herself a new set of cares in another direction,
and has just as many anxieties as the most toilful housekeeper,
only they are of a different kind. Talk of labor,
and look at the upper classes in London or in New York
in the fashionable season. Do any women work harder?
To rush from crowd to crowd all night, night after night,
seeing what they are tired of, making the agreeable over an
abyss of inward yawning, crowded, jostled, breathing hot
air, and crushed in halls and stairways, without a moment
of leisure for months and months, till brain and nerve and
sense reel, and the country is longed for as a period of resuscitation
and relief! Such is the release from labor and
fatigue brought by wealth. The only thing that makes
all this labor at all endurable is, that it is utterly and entirely
useless, and does no good to any one in creation;
this alone makes it genteel, and distinguishes it from the
vulgar toils of a housekeeper. These delicate creatures, who
can go to three or four parties a night for three months,
would be utterly desolate if they had to watch one night in a
sick-room; and though they can exhibit any amount of physical
endurance and vigor in crowding into assembly rooms,
and breathe tainted air in an opera-house with the most martyr-like
constancy, they could not sit one half-hour in the
close room where the sister of charity spends hours in consoling
the sick or aged poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Theophilus is quite at home now,&rdquo; said Jenny;
&ldquo;only start him on the track of fashionable life, and he
takes the course like a hound. But hear, now, our champion
of the &lsquo;Evening Post&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The instinct of women to seek a life of repose, their
eagerness to attain the life of elegance, does not mean contempt
for labor, but it is a confession of unfitness for labor.
Women were not intended to work,&mdash;not because work is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
ignoble, but because it is as disastrous to the beauty of a
woman as is friction to the bloom and softness of a flower.
Woman is to be kept in the garden of life; she is to rest,
to receive, to praise; she is to be kept from the workshop
world, where innocence is snatched with rude hands, and
softness is blistered into unsightliness or hardened into
adamant. No social truth is more in need of exposition
and illustration than this one; and, above all, the people
of New England need to know it, and, better, they need to
believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is therefore with regret that we discover Christopher
Crowfield applying so harshly, and, as we think so indiscriminatingly,
the theory of work to women, and teaching
a society made up of women sacrificed in the workshops of
the State, or to the dustpans and kitchens of the house,
that women must work, ought to work, and are dishonored
if they do not work; and that a woman committed to the
drudgery of a household is more creditably employed than
when she is charming, fascinating, irresistible, in the parlor
or boudoir. The consequence of this fatal mistake is manifest
throughout New England,&mdash;in New England where
the girls are all beautiful and the wives and mothers faded,
disfigured, and without charm or attractiveness. The moment
a girl marries, in New England, she is apt to become a drudge
or a lay figure on which to exhibit the latest fashions. She
never has beautiful hands, and she would not have a beautiful
face if a utilitarian society could &ldquo;apply&rdquo; her face to
anything but the pleasure of the eye. Her hands lose their
shape and softness after childhood, and domestic drudgery
destroys her beauty of form and softness and bloom of complexion
after marriage. To correct, or rather to break up,
this despotism of household cares, or of work, over woman,
American society must be taught that women will inevitably
fade and deteriorate, unless it insures repose and comfort to
them. It must be taught that reverence for beauty is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
normal condition, while the theory of work, applied to women,
is disastrous alike to beauty and morals. Work, when it is
destructive to men or women, is forced and unjust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the great masculine or creative epochs have been
distinguished by spontaneous work on the part of men, and
universal reverence and care for beauty. The praise of
work, and sacrifice of women to this great heartless devil
of work, belong only to, and are the social doctrine of, a
mechanical age and a utilitarian epoch. And if the New
England idea of social life continues to bear so cruelly on
woman, we shall have a reaction somewhat unexpected and
shocking.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, say what you will,&rdquo; said Rudolph, &ldquo;you
have expressed my idea of the conditions of the sex.
Woman was not made to work; she was made to be taken
care of by man. All that is severe and trying, whether in
study or in practical life, is and ought to be in its very nature
essentially the work of the male sex. The value of
woman is precisely the value of those priceless works of art
for which we build museums,&mdash;which we shelter and guard
as the world&rsquo;s choicest heritage; and a lovely, cultivated,
refined woman, thus sheltered, and guarded, and developed,
has a worth that cannot be estimated by any gross, material
standard. So I subscribe to the sentiments of Miss Jenny&rsquo;s
friend without scruple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great trouble in settling all these society questions,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;lies in the gold-washing&mdash;the cradling I
think the miners call it. If all the quartz were in one
stratum and all the gold in another, it would save us a vast
deal of trouble. In the ideas of Jenny&rsquo;s friend of the
&lsquo;Evening Post&rsquo; there is a line of truth and a line of falsehood
so interwoven and threaded together that it is impossible
wholly to assent or dissent. So with your ideas, Rudolph,
there is a degree of truth in them, but there is also
a fallacy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a truth, that woman as a sex ought not to do the
hard work of the world, either social, intellectual, or moral.
These are evidences in her physiology that this was not intended
for her, and our friend of the &lsquo;Evening Post&rsquo; is right
in saying that any country will advance more rapidly in
civilization and refinement where woman is thus sheltered
and protected. And I think, furthermore, that there is no
country in the world where women <i>are</i> so much considered
and cared for and sheltered, in every walk of life, as in
America. In England and France,&mdash;all over the continent
of Europe, in fact,&mdash;the other sex are deferential to
women only from some presumption of their social standing,
or from the fact of acquaintanceship; but among strangers,
and under circumstances where no particular rank or position
can be inferred, a woman traveling in England or
France is jostled and pushed to the wall, and left to take
her own chance, precisely as if she were not a woman.
Deference to delicacy and weakness, the instinct of protection,
does not appear to characterize the masculine population
of any other quarter of the world so much as that
of America. In France, <i>les Messieurs</i> will form a circle
round the fire in the receiving-room of a railroad station,
and sit, tranquilly smoking their cigars, while ladies who do
not happen to be of their acquaintance are standing shivering
at the other side of the room. In England, if a lady is
incautiously booked for an outside place on a coach, in hope
of seeing the scenery, and the day turns out hopelessly
rainy, no gentleman in the coach below ever thinks of offering
to change seats with her, though it pour torrents. In
America, the roughest backwoods steamboat or canal-boat captain
always, as a matter of course, considers himself charged
with the protection of the ladies. &lsquo;<i>Place aux dames</i>&rsquo; is
written in the heart of many a shaggy fellow who could
not utter a French word any more than could a buffalo.
It is just as I have before said,&mdash;women are the recognized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
aristocracy, the only aristocracy, of America; and, so
far from regarding this fact as objectionable, it is an unceasing
source of pride in my country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kind of knightly feeling towards woman which
reverences her delicacy, her frailty, which protects and cares
for her, is, I think, the crown of manhood; and without it
a man is only a rough animal. But our fair aristocrats and
their knightly defenders need to be cautioned lest they lose
their position, as many privileged orders have before done,
by an arrogant and selfish use of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said that the vices of aristocracy are more developed
among women in America than among men, and that,
while there are no men in the Northern States who are not
ashamed of living a merely idle life of pleasure, there are
many women who make a boast of helplessness and ignorance
in woman&rsquo;s family duties which any man would be
ashamed to make with regard to man&rsquo;s duties, as if such
helplessness and ignorance were a grace and a charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are women who contentedly live on, year after
year, a life of idleness, while the husband and father is
straining every nerve, growing prematurely old and gray,
abridged of almost every form of recreation or pleasure,&mdash;all
that he may keep them in a state of careless ease
and festivity. It may be very fine, very generous, very
knightly, in the man who thus toils at the oar that his
princesses may enjoy their painted voyages; but what is it
for the women?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman is a moral being&mdash;an immortal soul&mdash;before
she is a woman; and as such she is charged by her Maker
with some share of the great burden of work which lies on
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-denial, the bearing of the cross, are stated by Christ
as indispensable conditions to the entrance into his kingdom,
and no exception is made for man or woman. Some task,
some burden, some cross, each one must carry; and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
must be something done in every true and worthy life, not
as amusement, but as duty,&mdash;not as play, but as earnest
work,&mdash;and no human being can attain to the Christian
standard without this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jesus Christ took a towel and girded himself,
poured water into a basin, and washed his disciples&rsquo; feet, he
performed a significant and sacramental act, which no man
or woman should ever forget. If wealth and rank and power
absolve from the services of life, then certainly were Jesus
Christ absolved, as he says: &lsquo;Ye call me Master, and Lord.
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
ye also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet. For I have
given you an example, that ye should do as I have done
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let a man who seeks to make a terrestrial paradise for
the woman of his heart,&mdash;to absolve her from all care,
from all labor, to teach her to accept and to receive the
labor of others without any attempt to offer labor in return,&mdash;consider
whether he is not thus going directly against
the fundamental idea of Christianity; taking the direct way
to make his idol selfish and exacting, to rob her of the highest
and noblest beauty of womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that chapter of the Bible where the relation between
man and woman is stated, it is thus said, with quaint simplicity:
&lsquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will
make him an <i>help meet</i> for him.&rsquo; Woman the <i>helper</i> of
man, not his toy,&mdash;not a picture, not a statue, not a work
of art, but a <span class='smcaplc'>HELPER</span>, a doer,&mdash;such is the view of the
Bible and the Christian religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary that women should work physically
or morally to an extent which impairs beauty. In France,
where woman is harnessed with an ass to the plough which
her husband drives,&mdash;where she digs, and wields the pick-axe,&mdash;she
becomes prematurely hideous; but in America,
where woman reigns as queen in every household, she may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
surely be a good and thoughtful housekeeper, she may have
physical strength exercised in lighter domestic toils, not only
without injuring her beauty, but with manifest advantage
to it. Almost every growing young girl would be the better
in health, and therefore handsomer, for two hours of
active housework daily; and the habit of usefulness thereby
gained would be an equal advantage to her moral development.
The labors of modern, well-arranged houses are not
in any sense severe; they are as gentle as any kind of exercise
that can be devised, and they bring into play muscles
that ought to be exercised to be healthily developed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great danger to the beauty of American women does
not lie, as the writer of the &lsquo;Post&rsquo; contends, in an overworking
of the physical system which shall stunt and deform; on
the contrary, American women of the comfortable classes are
in danger of a loss of physical beauty from the entire deterioration
of the muscular system for want of exercise. Take
the life of any American girl in one of our large towns, and
see what it is. We have an educational system of public
schools which for intellectual culture is a just matter of pride
to any country. From the time that the girl is seven years
old, her first thought, when she rises in the morning, is to eat
her breakfast and be off to her school. There really is no
more time than enough to allow her to make that complete
toilet which every well-bred female ought to make, and to
take her morning meal before her school begins. She returns
at noon with just time to eat her dinner, and the
afternoon session begins. She comes home at night with
books, slate, and lessons enough to occupy her evening.
What time is there for teaching her any household work,
for teaching her to cut or fit or sew, or to inspire her with
any taste for domestic duties? Her arms have no exercise;
her chest and lungs, and all the complex system of muscles
which are to be perfected by quick and active movement,
are compressed while she bends over book and slate and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
drawing-board; while the ever active brain is kept all the
while going at the top of its speed. She grows up spare, thin,
and delicate; and while the Irish girl, who sweeps the parlors,
rubs the silver, and irons the muslins, is developing a
finely rounded arm and bust, the American girl has a pair
of bones at her sides, and a bust composed of cotton padding,
the work of a skillful dressmaker. Nature, who is no
respecter of persons, gives to Colleen Bawn, who uses her
arms and chest, a beauty which perishes in the gentle, languid
Edith, who does nothing but study and read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it not a fact,&rdquo; said Rudolph, &ldquo;as stated by our
friend of the &lsquo;Post,&rsquo; that American matrons are perishing,
and their beauty and grace all withered, from overwork?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;but why? It is because they
are brought up without vigor or muscular strength, without
the least practical experience of household labor, or those
means of saving it which come by daily practice; and then,
after marriage, when physically weakened by maternity,
embarrassed by the care of young children, they are often
suddenly deserted by every efficient servant, and the whole
machinery of a complicated household left in their weak,
inexperienced hands. In the country, you see a household
perhaps made void some fine morning by Biddy&rsquo;s sudden
departure, and nobody to make the bread, or cook the steak,
or sweep the parlors, or do one of the complicated offices of
a family, and no bakery, cook-shop, or laundry to turn to
for alleviation. A lovely, refined home becomes in a few
hours a howling desolation; and then ensues a long season
of breakage, waste, distraction, as one wild Irish immigrant
after another introduces the style of Irish cottage life into
an elegant dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now suppose I grant to the &lsquo;Evening Post&rsquo; that woman
ought to rest, to be kept in the garden of life, and
all that, how is this to be done in a country where a state
of things like this is the commonest of occurrences? And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
is it any kindness or reverence to woman, to educate her
for such an inevitable destiny by a life of complete physical
delicacy and incapacity? Many a woman who has been
brought into these cruel circumstances would willingly exchange
all her knowledge of German and Italian, and all
her graceful accomplishments, for a good physical development,
and some respectable <i>savoir faire</i> in ordinary life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, American matrons are overworked because
some unaccountable glamour leads them to continue to
bring up their girls in the same inefficient physical habits
which resulted in so much misery to themselves. Housework
as they are obliged to do it, untrained, untaught, exhausted,
and in company with rude, dirty, unkempt foreigners,
seems to them a degradation which they will spare
to their daughters. The daughter goes on with her schools
and accomplishments, and leads in the family the life of an
elegant little visitor during all those years when a young
girl might be gradually developing and strengthening her
muscles in healthy household work. It never occurs to
her that she can or ought to fill any of the domestic gaps
into which her mother always steps; and she comforts herself
with the thought, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how; I can&rsquo;t; I
haven&rsquo;t the strength. I can&rsquo;t sweep; it blisters my hands.
If I should stand at the ironing-table an hour, I should
be ill for a week. As to cooking, I don&rsquo;t know anything
about it.&rsquo; And so, when the cook, or the chambermaid, or
nurse, or all together, vacate the premises, it is the mamma
who is successively cook, and chambermaid, and nurse; and
this is the reason why matrons fade and are overworked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Rudolph, do you think a woman any less
beautiful or interesting because she is a fully developed physical
being,&mdash;because her muscles have been rounded and
matured into strength, so that she can meet the inevitable
emergencies of life without feeling them to be distressing
hardships? If there be a competent, well-trained servant to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
sweep and dust the parlor, and keep all the machinery of
the house in motion, she may very properly select her work
out of the family, in some form of benevolent helpfulness;
but when the inevitable evil hour comes, which is likely to
come first or last in every American household, is a woman
any less an elegant woman because her love of neatness,
order, and beauty leads her to make vigorous personal exertions
to keep her own home undefiled? For my part,
I think a disorderly, ill-kept home, a sordid, uninviting
table, has driven more husbands from domestic life than
the unattractiveness of any overworked woman. So long
as a woman makes her home harmonious and orderly, so
long as the hour of assembling around the family table
is something to be looked forward to as a comfort and a
refreshment, a man cannot see that the good house fairy,
who by some magic keeps everything so delightfully, has
either a wrinkle or a gray hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must tell you, Rudolph, what you
fellows of twenty-one are slow to believe; and that is, that
the kind of ideal paradise you propose in marriage is, in the
very nature of things, an impossibility,&mdash;that the familiarities
of every-day life between two people who keep house
together must and will destroy it. Suppose you are married
to Cytherea herself, and the next week attacked with
a rheumatic fever. If the tie between you is that of true
and honest love, Cytherea will put on a gingham wrapper,
and with her own sculptured hands wring out the flannels
which shall relieve your pains; and she will be no true
woman if she do not prefer to do this to employing any
nurse that could be hired. True love ennobles and dignifies
the material labors of life; and homely services rendered for
love&rsquo;s sake have in them a poetry that is immortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No true-hearted woman can find herself, in real, actual
life, unskilled and unfit to minister to the wants and sorrows
of those dearest to her, without a secret sense of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
degradation. The feeling of uselessness is an extremely unpleasant
one. Tom Hood, in a very humorous paper, describes
a most accomplished schoolmistress, a teacher of all
the arts and crafts which are supposed to make up fine
gentlewomen, who is stranded in a rude German inn, with
her father writhing in the anguish of a severe attack of
gastric inflammation. The helpless lady gazes on her suffering
parent, longing to help him, and thinking over all
her various little store of accomplishments, not one of which
bears the remotest relation to the case. She could knit him
a bead purse, or make him a guard-chain, or work him a
footstool, or festoon him with cut tissue-paper, or sketch his
likeness, or crust him over with alum crystals, or stick him
over with little rosettes of red and white wafers; but none
of these being applicable to his present case, she sits gazing
in resigned imbecility, till finally she desperately resolves
to improvise him some gruel, and, after a laborious turn in
the kitchen,&mdash;after burning her dress and blacking her
fingers,&mdash;succeeds only in bringing him a bowl of paste!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unlike this might be the feeling of many an elegant
and accomplished woman, whose education has taught
and practiced her in everything that woman ought to know,
except those identical ones which fit her for the care of a
home, for the comfort of a sick-room; and so I say again
that, whatever a woman may be in the way of beauty and
elegance, she must have the strength and skill of a practical
worker, or she is nothing. She is not simply to be the
beautiful,&mdash;she is to make the beautiful, and preserve it;
and she who makes and she who keeps the beautiful must
be able to work, and know how to work. Whatever offices
of life are performed by women of culture and refinement
are thenceforth elevated; they cease to be mere servile toils,
and become expressions of the ideas of superior beings. If
a true lady makes even a plate of toast, in arranging a <i>petit
souper</i> for her invalid friend, she does it as a lady should.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
She does not cut blundering and uneven slices; she does
not burn the edges; she does not deluge it with bad butter,
and serve it cold; but she arranges and serves all with an
artistic care, with a nicety and delicacy, which make it
worth one&rsquo;s while to have a lady friend in sickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am glad to hear that Monsieur Blot is teaching
classes of New York ladies that cooking is not a vulgar
kitchen toil, to be left to blundering servants, but an elegant
feminine accomplishment, better worth a woman&rsquo;s
learning than crochet or embroidery; and that a well-kept
culinary apartment may be so inviting and orderly that no
lady need feel her ladyhood compromised by participating
in its pleasant toils. I am glad to know that his cooking-academy
is thronged with more scholars than he can accommodate,
and from ladies in the best classes of society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, I am glad to see that in New Bedford, recently,
a public course of instruction in the art of bread-making
has been commenced by a lady, and that classes of
the most respectable young and married ladies in the place
are attending them. These are steps in the right direction,
and show that our fair countrywomen, with the grand
good sense which is their leading characteristic, are resolved
to supply whatever in our national life is wanting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not fear that women of such sense and energy
will listen to the sophistries which would persuade them
that elegant imbecility and inefficiency are charms of cultivated
womanhood or ingredients in the poetry of life.
She alone can keep the poetry and beauty of married life
who has this poetry in her soul; who with energy and discretion
can throw back and out of sight the sordid and
disagreeable details which beset all human living, and can
keep in the foreground that which is agreeable; who has
enough knowledge of practical household matters to make
unskilled and rude hands minister to her cultivated and refined
tastes, and constitute her skilled brain the guide of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
unskilled hands. From such a home, with such a mistress,
no sirens will seduce a man, even though the hair grow
gray, and the merely physical charms of early days gradually
pass away. The enchantment that was about her person
alone in the days of courtship seems in the course of
years to have interfused and penetrated the home which
she has created, and which in every detail is only an expression
of her personality. Her thoughts, her plans, her
provident care, are everywhere; and the home attracts and
holds by a thousand ties the heart which before marriage
was held by the woman alone.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>V <br /><br />THE TRANSITION</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, my dear,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that you have
thrown a stone into a congregation of blackbirds, in writing
as you have of our family wars and wants. The response
comes from all parts of the country, and the task of looking
over and answering your letters becomes increasingly formidable.
Everybody has something to say,&mdash;something to
propose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a résumé,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;here are three pages from an
elderly gentleman, to the effect that women are not what they
used to be,&mdash;that daughters are a great care and no help,
that girls have no health and no energy in practical life,
that the expense of maintaining a household is so great that
young men are afraid to marry, and that it costs more now per
annum to dress one young woman than it used to cost to carry
a whole family of sons through college. In short, the poor
old gentleman is in a desperate state of mind, and is firmly
of opinion that society is going to ruin by an express train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old fellow!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the only comfort I can
offer him is what I take myself,&mdash;that this sad world will
last out our time at least. Now for the next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next is more concise and spicy,&rdquo; said my wife.
&ldquo;I will read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Christopher Crowfield, Esq.</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sir</i>,&mdash;If you want to know how American women
are to be brought back to family work, I can tell you a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
short method. Pay them as good wages for it as they can
make in any other way. I get from seven to nine dollars
a week in a shop where I work; if I could make the same
in any good family, I should have no objection to doing it.</p>
<p class='sig1'>&ldquo;Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class='sig2'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Letitia.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My correspondent Letitia does not tell me,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;how much of this seven or nine dollars she pays out for
board and washing, fire and lights. If she worked in a
good family at two or three dollars a week, it is easily demonstrable
that, at the present cost of these items, she
would make as much clear profit as she now does at nine
dollars for her shop-work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are two other things, moreover, which she
does not consider: First, that, besides board, washing, fuel,
and lights, which she would have in a family, she would
have also less unintermitted toil. Shop-work exacts its ten
hours per diem; and it makes no allowance for sickness or
accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good domestic in a good family finds many hours
when she can feel free to attend to her own affairs. Her
work consists of certain definite matters, which being done
her time is her own; and if she have skill and address in
the management of her duties, she may secure many leisure
hours. As houses are now built, and with the many labor-saving
conveniences that are being introduced, the physical
labor of housework is no more than a healthy woman really
needs to keep her in health. In case, however, of those
slight illnesses to which all are more or less liable, and
which, if neglected, often lead to graver ones, the advantage
is still on the side of domestic service. In the shop and
factory, every hour of unemployed time is deducted; an
illness of a day or two is an appreciable loss of just so much
money, while the expense of board is still going on. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
in the family a good servant is always considered. When
ill, she is carefully nursed as one of the family, has the
family physician, and is subject to no deduction from her
wages for loss of time. I have known more than one instance
in which a valued domestic has been sent, at her
employer&rsquo;s expense, to the seaside or some other pleasant
locality, for change of air, when her health has been run
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, family work is more remunerative,
even at a lower rate of wages, than shop or factory work,
because it is better for the health. All sorts of sedentary
employment, pursued by numbers of persons together in one
apartment, are more or less debilitating and unhealthy,
through foul air and confinement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s health is her capital. In certain ways of
work she obtains more income, but she spends on her capital
to do it. In another way she may get less income, and yet
increase her capital. A woman cannot work at dressmaking,
tailoring, or any other sedentary employment, ten hours
a day, year in and out, without enfeebling her constitution,
impairing her eyesight, and bringing on a complication of
complaints, but she can sweep, wash, cook, and do the varied
duties of a well-ordered house with modern arrangements,
and grow healthier every year. The times, in New
England, when all women did housework a part of every
day, were the times when all women were healthy. At
present, the heritage of vigorous muscles, firm nerves, strong
backs, and cheerful physical life has gone from American
women, and is taken up by Irish women. A thrifty young
man I have lately heard of married a rosy young Irish girl,
quite to the horror of his mother and sisters, but defended
himself by the following very conclusive logic: &lsquo;If I marry
an American girl, I must have an Irish girl to take care of
her; and I cannot afford to support both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides all this, there is a third consideration, which I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
humbly commend to my friend Letitia. The turn of her
note speaks her a girl of good common sense, with a faculty
of hitting the nail square on the head; and such a girl must
see that nothing is more likely to fall out than that she
will some day be married. Evidently, our fair friend is
born to rule; and at this hour, doubtless, her foreordained
throne and humble servant are somewhere awaiting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now domestic service is all the while fitting a girl
physically, mentally, and morally for her ultimate vocation
and sphere,&mdash;to be a happy wife and to make a happy
home. But factory work, shop work, and all employments
of that sort, are in their nature essentially undomestic,&mdash;entailing
the constant necessity of a boarding-house life, and
of habits as different as possible from the quiet routine of
home. The girl who is ten hours on the strain of continued,
unintermitted toil feels no inclination, when evening
comes, to sit down and darn her stockings, or make
over her dresses, or study any of those multifarious economies
which turn a wardrobe to the best account. Her
nervous system is flagging; she craves company and excitement;
and her dull, narrow room is deserted for some place
of amusement or gay street promenade. And who can
blame her? Let any sensible woman, who has had experience
of shop and factory life, recall to her mind the ways
and manners in which young girls grow up who leave a
father&rsquo;s roof for a crowded boarding-house, without any supervision
of matron or mother, and ask whether this is the
best school for training young American wives and mothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless there are discreet and thoughtful women who,
amid all these difficulties, do keep up thrifty, womanly
habits, but they do it by an effort greater than the majority
of girls are willing to make, and greater than they ought to
make. To sew or read or study after ten hours of factory
or shop work is a further drain on the nervous powers
which no woman can long endure without exhaustion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When the time arrives that such a girl comes to a house
of her own, she comes to it as unskilled in all household
lore, with muscles as incapable of domestic labor and nerves
as sensitive, as if she had been leading the most luxurious,
do-nothing, fashionable life. How different would be her
preparation, had the forming years of her life been spent in
the labors of a family! I know at this moment a lady at
the head of a rich country establishment, filling her station
in society with dignity and honor, who gained her domestic
education in a kitchen in our vicinity. She was the daughter
of a small farmer, and when the time came for her to be
earning her living, her parents wisely thought it far better
that she should gain it in a way which would at the same
time establish her health and fit her for her own future
home. In a cheerful, light, airy kitchen, which was kept
so tidy always as to be an attractive sitting-room, she and
another young country girl were trained up in the best of
domestic economies by a mistress who looked well to the
ways of her household, till at length they married from the
house with honor, and went to practice in homes of their
own the lessons they had learned in the home of another.
Formerly, in New England, such instances were not uncommon;
would that they might become so again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;the places which the
daughters of American farmers used to occupy in our families
are now taken by young girls from the families of
small farmers in Ireland. They are respectable, tidy,
healthy, and capable of being taught. A good mistress,
who is reasonable and liberal in her treatment, is able to
make them fixtures. They get good wages, and have few
expenses. They dress handsomely, have abundant leisure
to take care of their clothes and turn their wardrobes to
the best account, and they very soon acquire skill in doing
it equal to that displayed by any women of any country.
They remit money continually to relatives in Ireland, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
from time to time pay the passage of one and another to
this country,&mdash;and whole families have thus been established
in American life by the efforts of one young girl.
Now, for my part, I do not grudge my Irish fellow citizens
these advantages obtained by honest labor and good conduct;
they deserve all the good fortune thus accruing to them.
But when I see sickly, nervous American women jostling
and struggling in the few crowded avenues which are open
to mere brain, I cannot help thinking how much better
their lot would have been, with good strong bodies, steady
nerves, healthy digestion, and the habit of looking any
kind of work in the face, which used to be characteristic
of American women generally, and of Yankee women in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter becomes still graver,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by the laws
of descent. The woman who enfeebles her muscular system
by sedentary occupation, and over-stimulates her brain and
nervous system, when she becomes a mother perpetuates
these evils to her offspring. Her children will be born
feeble and delicate, incapable of sustaining any severe strain
of body or mind. The universal cry now about the ill
health of young American girls is the fruit of some three
generations of neglect of physical exercise and undue stimulus
of brain and nerves. Young girls now are universally
<i>born</i> delicate. The most careful hygienic treatment during
childhood, the strictest attention to diet, dress, and exercise,
succeeds merely so far as to produce a girl who is healthy
so long only as she does nothing. With the least strain,
her delicate organism gives out, now here, now there. She
cannot study without her eyes fail or she has headache,&mdash;she
cannot get up her own muslins, or sweep a room, or
pack a trunk, without bringing on a backache,&mdash;she goes
to a concert or a lecture, and must lie by all the next day
from the exertion. If she skates, she is sure to strain some
muscle; or if she falls and strikes her knee or hits her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
ankle, a blow that a healthy girl would forget in five minutes
terminates in some mysterious lameness which confines
our poor sibyl for months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young American girl of our times is a creature who
has not a particle of vitality to spare,&mdash;no reserved stock
of force to draw upon in cases of family exigency. She is
exquisitely strung, she is cultivated, she is refined; but she
is too nervous, too wiry, too sensitive,&mdash;she burns away
too fast; only the easiest of circumstances, the most watchful
of care and nursing, can keep her within the limits of
comfortable health; and yet this is the creature who must
undertake family life in a country where it is next to an
absolute impossibility to have permanent domestics. Frequent
change, occasional entire breakdowns, must be the lot
of the majority of housekeepers,&mdash;particularly those who
do not live in cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;we in America have so far
got out of the way of a womanhood that has any vigor of
outline or opulence of physical proportions that, when we
see a woman made as a woman ought to be, she strikes us
as a monster. Our willowy girls are afraid of nothing so
much as growing stout; and if a young lady begins to round
into proportions like the women in Titian&rsquo;s and Giorgione&rsquo;s
pictures, she is distressed above measure, and begins to
make secret inquiries into reducing diet, and to cling desperately
to the strongest corset-lacing as her only hope. It
would require one to be better educated than most of our
girls are, to be willing to look like the Sistine Madonna or
the Venus of Milo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in a while our Italian opera-singers bring to our
shores those glorious physiques which formed the inspiration
of Italian painters; and then American editors make coarse
jokes about Barnum&rsquo;s fat woman, and avalanches, and pretend
to be struck with terror at such dimensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be better instructed, and consider that Italy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
does us a favor, in sending us specimens, not only of higher
styles of musical art, but of a warmer, richer, and more
abundant womanly life. The magnificent voice is only in
keeping with the magnificent proportions of the singer. A
voice which has no grate, no strain, which flows without
effort,&mdash;which does not labor eagerly up to a high note,
but alights on it like a bird from above, there carelessly
warbling and trilling,&mdash;a voice which then without effort
sinks into broad, rich, sombre depths of soft, heavy chest-tone,&mdash;can
come only with a physical nature at once strong,
wide, and fine,&mdash;from a nature such as the sun of Italy
ripens, as he does her golden grapes, filling it with the new
wine of song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so much for our strictures on Miss
Letitia&rsquo;s letter. What comes next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a correspondent who answers the question,
&lsquo;What shall we do with her?&rsquo;&mdash;apropos of the case of
the distressed young woman which we considered in our
first chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does he recommend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tells us that he should advise us to make our distressed
woman Marianne&rsquo;s housekeeper, and to send South
for three or four contrabands for her to train, and, with
great apparent complacency, seems to think that course will
solve all similar cases of difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a man&rsquo;s view of the subject,&rdquo; said Jenny.
&ldquo;They think any woman who isn&rsquo;t particularly fitted to
do anything else can keep house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if housekeeping were not the very highest craft and
mystery of social life,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I admit that our sex speak
too unadvisedly on such topics, and, being well instructed
by my household priestesses, will humbly suggest the following
ideas to my correspondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st. A woman is not of course fit to be a housekeeper
because she is a woman of good education and refinement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;2d. If she were, a family with young children in it is
not the proper place to establish a school for untaught contrabands,
however desirable their training may be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman of good education and good common sense
may learn to be a good housekeeper, as she learns any trade,
by going into a good family and practicing first one and
then another branch of the business, till finally she shall
acquire the comprehensive knowledge to direct all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next letter I will read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Crowfield</span>,&mdash;Your papers relating to
the domestic problem have touched upon a difficulty which
threatens to become a matter of life and death with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a young man, with good health, good courage,
and good prospects. I have, for a young man, a fair
income, and a prospect of its increase. But my business
requires me to reside in a country town, near a great manufacturing
city. The demand for labor there has made such
a drain on the female population of the vicinity, that it
seems, for a great part of the time, impossible to keep any
servants at all; and what we can hire are of the poorest
quality, and want exorbitant wages. My wife was a well-trained
housekeeper, and knows perfectly all that pertains
to the care of a family; but she has three little children,
and a delicate babe only a few weeks old; and can any one
woman do all that is needed for such a household? Something
must be trusted to servants; and what is thus trusted
brings such confusion and waste and dirt into our house,
that the poor woman is constantly distraught between the
disgust of having them and the utter impossibility of doing
without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it has been suggested that we remedy the trouble
by paying higher wages; but I find that for the very
highest wages I secure only the most miserable service;
and yet, poor as it is, we are obliged to put up with it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
because there is an amount of work to be done in our family
that is absolutely beyond my wife&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see her health wearing away under these trials, her
life made a burden; I feel no power to help her, and I
ask you, Mr. Crowfield, What are we to do? What is to
become of family life in this country?</p>
<p class='sig1'>&ldquo;Yours truly,</p>
<p class='sig2'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>A Young Family Man</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;touches upon the very
hinge of the difficulty of domestic life with the present
generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real, vital difficulty, after all, in our American life
is, that our country is so wide, so various, so abounding in
the richest fields of enterprise, that in every direction the
cry is of the plenteousness of the harvest and the fewness
of the laborers. In short, there really are not laborers
enough to do the work of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the war has thrown the whole South open to
the competition of free labor, the demand for workers is
doubled and trebled. Manufactories of all sorts are enlarging
their borders, increasing their machinery, and calling
for more hands. Every article of living is demanded with
an imperativeness and over an extent of territory which set
at once additional thousands to the task of production.
Instead of being easier to find hands to execute in all
branches of useful labor, it is likely to grow every year
more difficult, as new departments of manufacture and trade
divide the workers. The price of labor, even now higher in
this country than in any other, will rise still higher, and thus
complicate still more the problem of domestic life. Even if
a reasonable quota of intelligent women choose domestic service,
the demand will be increasingly beyond the supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you to say to this,&rdquo; said my wife,
&ldquo;seeing you cannot stop the prosperity of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this,&mdash;that communities will be driven to
organize, as they now do in Europe, to lessen the labors of
individual families by having some of the present domestic
tasks done out of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In France, for example, no housekeeper counts either
washing, ironing, or bread-making as part of her domestic
cares. All the family washing goes out to a laundry, and being
attended to by those who make that department of labor
a specialty, it comes home in refreshingly beautiful order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We in America, though we pride ourselves on our
Yankee thrift, are far behind the French in domestic
economy. If all the families of a neighborhood should
put together the sums they separately spend in buying or
fitting up and keeping in repair tubs, boilers, and other
accommodations for washing, all that is consumed or wasted
in soap, starch, bluing, fuel, together with the wages and
board of an extra servant, the aggregate would suffice to
fit up a neighborhood laundry, where one or two capable
women could do easily and well what ten or fifteen women
now do painfully and ill, and to the confusion and derangement
of all other family processes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The model laundries for the poor in London had facilities
which would enable a woman to do both the washing
and ironing of a small family in from two to three hours,
and were so arranged that a very few women could, with
ease, do the work of a neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the absence of an establishment of this sort,
the housekeepers of a country village might help themselves
very much by owning a mangle in common, to which
all the heavier parts of the ironing could be sent. American
ingenuity has greatly improved the machinery of the
mangle. It is no longer the heavy, cumbersome, structure
that it used to be in the Old World, but a compact, neat
piece of apparatus, made in three or four different sizes to
suit different-sized apartments.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. H. F. Bond, of Waltham, Massachusetts, now
manufactures these articles, and sends them to all parts of
the country. The smallest of them does not take up much
more room than a sewing-machine, can be turned by a boy
of ten or twelve, and thus in the course of an hour or two
the heaviest and most fatiguing part of a family ironing may
be accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should certainly advise the &lsquo;Young Family Man&rsquo;
with a delicate wife and uncertain domestic help to fortify
his kitchen with one of these fixtures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all, I still say that the quarter to which I
look for the solution of the American problem of domestic
life is a wise use of the principle of association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future model village of New England, as I see it,
shall have for the use of its inhabitants not merely a town
lyceum hall and a town library, but a town laundry, fitted
up with conveniences such as no private house can afford,
and paying a price to the operators which will enable them
to command an excellence of work such as private families
seldom realize. It will also have a town bakery, where
the best of family bread, white, brown, and of all grains,
shall be compounded; and lastly a town cook-shop, where
soup and meats may be bought, ready for the table. Those
of us who have kept house abroad remember the ease with
which our foreign establishments were carried on. A suite
of elegant apartments, a courier, and one female servant
were the foundation of domestic life. Our courier boarded
us at a moderate expense, and the servant took care of our
rooms. Punctually at the dinner hour every day, our dinner
came in on the head of a porter from a neighboring
cook-shop. A large chest lined with tin, and kept warm
by a tiny charcoal stove in the centre, being deposited in
an anteroom, from it came forth first soup, then fish, then
roasts of various names, and lastly pastry and confections,&mdash;far
more courses than any reasonable Christian needs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
keep him in healthy condition; and dinner being over, our
box with its débris went out of the house, leaving a clear
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I put it to the distressed &lsquo;Young Family Man&rsquo;
whether these three institutions of a bakery, a cook-shop,
and a laundry, in the village where he lives, would not virtually
annihilate his household cares, and restore peace and
comfort to his now distracted family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There really is no more reason why every family should
make its own bread than its own butter,&mdash;why every family
should do its own washing and ironing than its own tailoring
or mantua-making. In France, where certainly the arts
of economy are well studied, there is some specialty for
many domestic needs for which we keep servants. The
beautiful inlaid floors are kept waxed and glossy by a professional
gentleman who wears a brush on his foot-sole,
skates gracefully over the surface, and, leaving all right,
departeth. Many families, each paying a small sum, keep
this servant in common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if ever there was a community which needed to
study the art of living, it is our American one; for, at
present, domestic life is so wearing and so oppressive as
seriously to affect health and happiness. Whatever has
been done abroad in the way of comfort and convenience
can be done here; and the first neighborhood that shall set
the example of dividing the tasks and burdens of life by
the judicious use of the principle of association will initiate
a most important step in the way of national happiness and
prosperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My solution, then, of the domestic problem may be formulized
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st. That women make self helpfulness and family
helpfulness fashionable, and every woman use her muscles
daily in enough household work to give her a good digestion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;2d. That the situation of a domestic be made so respectable
and respected that well-educated American women
shall be induced to take it as a training-school for their
future family life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3d. That families by association lighten the multifarious
labors of the domestic sphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which I humbly submit to the good sense and
enterprise of American readers and workers.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VI <br /><br />BODILY RELIGION: A SERMON ON GOOD HEALTH</h3>
</div>
<p>One of our recent writers has said, that &ldquo;good health is
physical religion;&rdquo; and it is a saying worthy to be printed
in golden letters. But good health being physical religion,
it fully shares that indifference with which the human race
regards things confessedly the most important. The neglect
of the soul is the trite theme of all religious teachers; and,
next to their souls, there is nothing that people neglect so
much as their bodies. Every person ought to be perfectly
healthy, just as everybody ought to be perfectly religious;
but, in point of fact, the greater part of mankind are so far
from perfect moral or physical religion that they cannot
even form a conception of the blessing beyond them.</p>
<p>The mass of good, well-meaning Christians are not yet
advanced enough to guess at the change which a perfect
fidelity to Christ&rsquo;s spirit and precepts would produce in
them. And the majority of people who call themselves
well, because they are not, at present, upon any particular
doctor&rsquo;s list, are not within sight of what perfect health
would be. That fullness of life, that vigorous tone, and
that elastic cheerfulness, which make the mere fact of existence
a luxury, that suppleness which carries one like a
well-built boat over every wave of unfavorable chance,&mdash;these
are attributes of the perfect health seldom enjoyed.
We see them in young children, in animals, and now and
then, but rarely, in some adult human being, who has preserved
intact the religion of the body through all opposing
influences. Perfect health supposes not a state of mere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
quiescence, but of positive enjoyment in living. See that
little fellow, as his nurse turns him out in the morning,
fresh from his bath, his hair newly curled, and his cheeks
polished like apples. Every step is a spring or a dance;
he runs, he laughs, he shouts, his face breaks into a thousand
dimpling smiles at a word. His breakfast of plain
bread and milk is swallowed with an eager and incredible
delight,&mdash;it is so good that he stops to laugh or thump the
table now and then in expression of his ecstasy. All day
long he runs and frisks and plays; and when at night the
little head seeks the pillow, down go the eye-curtains, and
sleep comes without a dream. In the morning his first note
is a laugh and a crow, as he sits up in his crib and tries to
pull papa&rsquo;s eyes open with his fat fingers. He is an embodied
joy,&mdash;he is sunshine and music and laughter for all
the house. With what a magnificent generosity does the
Author of life endow a little mortal pilgrim in giving him
at the outset of his career such a body as this! How miserable
it is to look forward twenty years, when the same
child, now grown a man, wakes in the morning with a dull,
heavy head, the consequence of smoking and studying till
twelve or one the night before; when he rises languidly to
a late breakfast, and turns from this and tries that,&mdash;wants
a deviled bone, or a cutlet with Worcestershire sauce, to
make eating possible; and then, with slow and plodding
step, finds his way to his office and his books. Verily the
shades of the prison-house gather round the growing boy;
for, surely, no one will deny that life often begins with
health little less perfect than that of the angels.</p>
<p>But the man who habitually wakes sodden, headachy,
and a little stupid, and who needs a cup of strong coffee and
various stimulating condiments to coax his bodily system
into something like fair working order, does not suppose he
is out of health. He says, &ldquo;Very well, I thank you,&rdquo; to
your inquiries,&mdash;merely because he has entirely forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
what good health is. He is well, not because of any particular
pleasure in physical existence, but well simply because
he is not a subject for prescriptions. Yet there is no
store of vitality, no buoyancy, no superabundant vigor, to
resist the strain and pressure to which life puts him. A
checked perspiration, a draught of air ill-timed, a crisis of
perplexing business or care, and he is down with a bilious
attack or an influenza, and subject to doctors&rsquo; orders for an
indefinite period. And if the case be so with men, how is
it with women? How many women have at maturity the
keen appetite, the joyous love of life and motion, the elasticity
and sense of physical delight in existence, that little
children have? How many have any superabundance of
vitality with which to meet the wear and strain of life?
And yet they call themselves well.</p>
<p>But is it possible, in maturity, to have the joyful fullness
of the life of childhood? Experience has shown that the
delicious freshness of this dawning hour may be preserved
even to midday, and may be brought back and restored after
it has been for years a stranger. Nature, though a severe
disciplinarian, is still, in many respects, most patient and
easy to be entreated, and meets any repentant movement of
her prodigal children with wonderful condescension. Take
Bulwer&rsquo;s account of the first few weeks of his sojourn at
Malvern, and you will read, in very elegant English, the
story of an experience of pleasure which has surprised and
delighted many a patient at a water-cure. The return to
the great primitive elements of health&mdash;water, air, and simple
food, with a regular system of exercise&mdash;has brought to
many a jaded, weary, worn-down human being the elastic
spirits, the simple, eager appetite, the sound sleep, of a little
child. Hence the rude huts and châlets of the peasant
Priessnitz were crowded with battered dukes and princesses
and notables of every degree, who came from the hot, enervating
luxury which had drained them of existence, to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
a keener pleasure in peasants&rsquo; bread under peasants&rsquo; roofs
than in soft raiment and palaces. No arts of French cookery
can possibly make anything taste so well to a feeble and
palled appetite as plain brown bread and milk taste to a
hungry water-cure patient, fresh from bath and exercise.</p>
<p>If the water-cure had done nothing more than establish
the fact that the glow and joyousness of early life are things
which may be restored after having been once wasted, it
would have done a good work. For if Nature is so forgiving
to those who have once lost or have squandered her
treasures, what may not be hoped for us if we can learn the
art of never losing the first health of childhood? And
though with us, who have passed to maturity, it may be too
late for the blessing, cannot something be done for the children
who are yet to come after us?</p>
<p>Why is the first health of childhood lost? Is it not the
answer, that childhood is the only period of life in which
bodily health is made a prominent object? Take our pretty
boy, with cheeks like apples, who started in life with a hop,
skip, and dance,&mdash;to whom laughter was like breathing,
and who was enraptured with plain bread and milk,&mdash;how
did he grow into the man who wakes so languid and dull,
who wants strong coffee and Worcestershire sauce to make
his breakfast go down? When and where did he drop the
invaluable talisman that once made everything look brighter
and taste better to him, however rude and simple, than now
do the most elaborate combinations? What is the boy&rsquo;s
history? Why, for the first seven years of his life his body
is made of some account. It is watched, cared for, dieted,
disciplined, fed with fresh air, and left to grow and develop
like a thrifty plant. But from the time school education begins,
the body is steadily ignored, and left to take care of
itself.</p>
<p>The boy is made to sit six hours a day in a close, hot
room, breathing impure air, putting the brain and the nervous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
system upon a constant strain, while the muscular system
is repressed to an unnatural quiet. During the six hours,
perhaps twenty minutes are allowed for all that play of the
muscles which, up to this time, has been the constant habit
of his life. After this he is sent home with books, slate,
and lessons to occupy an hour or two more in preparing for
the next day. In the whole of this time there is no kind
of effort to train the physical system by appropriate exercise.
Something of the sort was attempted years ago in the infant
schools, but soon given up; and now, from the time study
first begins, the muscles are ignored in all primary schools.
One of the first results is the loss of that animal vigor which
formerly made the boy love motion for its own sake. Even
in his leisure hours he no longer leaps and runs as he used
to; he learns to sit still, and by and by sitting and lounging
come to be the habit, and vigorous motion the exception, for
most of the hours of the day. The education thus begun
goes on from primary to high school, from high school to
college, from college through professional studies of law,
medicine, or theology, with this steady contempt for the
body, with no provision for its culture, training, or development,
but rather a direct and evident provision for its deterioration
and decay.</p>
<p>The want of suitable ventilation in school-rooms, recitation-rooms,
lecture-rooms, offices, court-rooms, conference-rooms,
and vestries, where young students of law, medicine,
and theology acquire their earlier practice, is something simply
appalling. Of itself it would answer for men the question,
why so many thousand glad, active children come to a
middle life without joy,&mdash;a life whose best estate is a sort
of slow, plodding endurance. The despite and hatred which
most men seem to feel for God&rsquo;s gift of fresh air, and their
resolution to breathe as little of it as possible, could only
come from a long course of education, in which they have
been accustomed to live without it. Let any one notice the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
conduct of our American people traveling in railroad cars.
We will suppose that about half of them are what might be
called well-educated people, who have learned in books, or
otherwise, that the air breathed from the lungs is laden
with impurities,&mdash;that it is noxious and poisonous; and
yet, travel with these people half a day, and you would
suppose from their actions that they considered the external
air as a poison created expressly to injure them, and that
the only course of safety lay in keeping the cars hermetically
sealed, and breathing over and over the vapor from
each others&rsquo; lungs. If a person in despair at the intolerable
foulness raises a window, what frowns from all the neighboring
seats, especially from great rough-coated men, who
always seem the first to be apprehensive! The request to
&ldquo;put down that window&rdquo; is almost sure to follow a moment
or two of fresh air. In vain have rows of ventilators
been put in the tops of some of the cars, for conductors and
passengers are both of one mind, that these ventilators are
inlets of danger, and must be kept carefully closed.</p>
<p>Railroad traveling in America is systematically, and one
would think carefully, arranged so as to violate every possible
law of health. The old rule to keep the head cool and
the feet warm is precisely reversed. A red-hot stove heats
the upper stratum of air to oppression, while a stream of
cold air is constantly circulating about the lower extremities.
The most indigestible and unhealthy substances conceivable
are generally sold in the cars or at way-stations for the confusion
and distress of the stomach. Rarely can a traveler
obtain so innocent a thing as a plain good sandwich of bread
and meat, while pie, cake, doughnuts, and all other culinary
atrocities are almost forced upon him at every stopping-place.
In France, England, and Germany, the railroad cars
are perfectly ventilated; the feet are kept warm by flat
cases filled with hot water and covered with carpet, and
answering the double purpose of warming the feet and diffusing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
an agreeable temperature through the car, without
burning away the vitality of the air; while the arrangements
at the refreshment-rooms provide for the passenger as
wholesome and well-served a meal of healthy, nutritious
food as could be obtained in any home circle.</p>
<p>What are we to infer concerning the home habits of a nation
of men who so resignedly allow their bodies to be poisoned
and maltreated in traveling over such an extent of
territory as is covered by our railroad lines? Does it not
show that foul air and improper food are too much matters
of course to excite attention? As a writer in &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo;
has lately remarked, it is simply and only because the
American nation like to have unventilated cars, and to be
fed on pie and coffee at stopping-places, that nothing better
is known to our travelers; if there were any marked dislike
of such a state of things on the part of the people, it would
not exist. We have wealth enough, and enterprise enough,
and ingenuity enough, in our American nation, to compass
with wonderful rapidity any end that really seems to us
desirable. An army was improvised when an army was
wanted,&mdash;and an army more perfectly equipped, more bountifully
fed, than so great a body of men ever was before.
Hospitals, Sanitary Commissions, and Christian Commissions
all arose out of the simple conviction of the American
people that they must arise. If the American people were
equally convinced that foul air was a poison,&mdash;that to have
cold feet and hot heads was to invite an attack of illness,&mdash;that
maple-sugar, popcorn, peppermint candy, pie, doughnuts,
and peanuts are not diet for reasonable beings,&mdash;they
would have railroad accommodations very different from
those now in existence.</p>
<p>We have spoken of the foul air of court-rooms. What
better illustration could be given of the utter contempt
with which the laws of bodily health are treated, than the
condition of these places? Our lawyers are our highly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
educated men. They have been through high-school and
college training, they have learned the properties of oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbonic-acid gas, and have seen a mouse die
under an exhausted receiver, and of course they know that
foul, unventilated rooms are bad for the health; and yet
generation after generation of men so taught and trained
will spend the greater part of their lives in rooms notorious
for their close and impure air, without so much as an attempt
to remedy the evil. A well-ventilated court-room is
a four-leaved clover among court-rooms. Young men are
constantly losing their health at the bar; lung diseases,
dyspepsia, follow them up, gradually sapping their vitality.
Some of the brightest ornaments of the profession have actually
fallen dead as they stood pleading,&mdash;victims of the
fearful pressure of poisonous and heated air upon the excited
brain. The deaths of Salmon P. Chase of Portland, uncle
of our present Chief Justice, and of Ezekiel Webster, the
brother of our great statesman, are memorable examples of
the calamitous effects of the errors dwelt upon; and yet,
strange to say, nothing efficient is done to mend these errors,
and give the body an equal chance with the mind in the
pressure of the world&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
<p>But churches, lecture-rooms, and vestries, and all buildings
devoted especially to the good of the soul, are equally
witness of the mind&rsquo;s disdain of the body&rsquo;s needs, and the
body&rsquo;s consequent revenge upon the soul. In how many
of these places has the question of a thorough provision of
fresh air been even considered? People would never think
of bringing a thousand persons into a desert place and keeping
them there without making preparations to feed them.
Bread and butter, potatoes and meat, must plainly be found
for them; but a thousand human beings are put into a
building to remain a given number of hours, and no one
asks the question whether means exist for giving each one
the quantum of fresh air needed for his circulation, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
these thousand victims will consent to be slowly poisoned,
gasping, sweating, getting red in the face, with confused
and sleepy brains, while a minister with a yet redder face
and a more oppressed brain struggles and wrestles, through
the hot, seething vapors, to make clear to them the mysteries
of faith. How many churches are there that for six or
eight months in the year are never ventilated at all, except
by the accidental opening of doors? The foul air generated
by one congregation is locked up by the sexton for
the use of the next assembly; and so gathers and gathers
from week to week, and month to month, while devout
persons upbraid themselves, and are ready to tear their hair,
because they always feel stupid and sleepy in church. The
proper ventilation of their churches and vestries would remove
that spiritual deadness of which their prayers and
hymns complain. A man hoeing his corn out on a breezy
hillside is bright and alert, his mind works clearly, and he
feels interested in religion, and thinks of many a thing that
might be said at the prayer-meeting at night. But at night,
when he sits down in a little room where the air reeks with
the vapor of his neighbor&rsquo;s breath and the smoke of kerosene
lamps, he finds himself suddenly dull and drowsy,&mdash;without
emotion, without thought, without feeling,&mdash;and
he rises and reproaches himself for this state of things. He
calls upon his soul and all that is within him to bless the
Lord; but the indignant body, abused, insulted, ignored,
takes the soul by the throat, and says, &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t let
<i>me</i> have a good time, neither shall you.&rdquo; Revivals of religion,
with ministers and with those people whose moral organization
leads them to take most interest in them, often
end in periods of bodily ill health and depression. But is
there any need of this? Suppose that a revival of religion
required, as a formula, that all the members of a given congregation
should daily take a minute dose of arsenic in concert,&mdash;we
should not be surprised after a while to hear of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
various ill effects therefrom; and, as vestries and lecture-rooms
are now arranged, a daily prayer-meeting is often
nothing more nor less than a number of persons spending
half an hour a day breathing poison from each other&rsquo;s lungs.
There is not only no need of this, but, on the contrary, a
good supply of pure air would make the daily prayer-meeting
far more enjoyable. The body, if allowed the slightest
degree of fair play, so far from being a contumacious infidel
and opposer, becomes a very fair Christian helper, and, instead
of throttling the soul, gives it wings to rise to celestial
regions.</p>
<p>This branch of our subject we will quit with one significant
anecdote. A certain rural church was somewhat famous
for its picturesque Gothic architecture, and equally famous
for its sleepy atmosphere, the rules of Gothic symmetry
requiring very small windows, which could be only partially
opened. Everybody was affected alike in this church; minister
and people complained that it was like the enchanted
ground in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. Do what they would,
sleep was ever at their elbows; the blue, red, and green of
the painted windows melted into a rainbow dimness of hazy
confusion; and ere they were aware, they were off on a
cloud to the land of dreams.</p>
<p>An energetic sister in the church suggested the inquiry,
whether it was ever ventilated, and discovered that it was
regularly locked up at the close of service, and remained so
till opened for the next week. She suggested the inquiry,
whether giving the church a thorough airing on Saturday
would not improve the Sunday services; but nobody acted
on her suggestion. Finally, she borrowed the sexton&rsquo;s key
one Saturday night, and went into the church and opened
all the windows herself, and let them remain so for the
night. The next day everybody remarked the improved
comfort of the church, and wondered what had produced
the change. Nevertheless, when it was discovered, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
not deemed a matter of enough importance to call for an
order on the sexton to perpetuate the improvement.</p>
<p>The ventilation of private dwellings in this country is
such as might be expected from that entire indifference to
the laws of health manifested in public establishments.
Let a person travel in private conveyance up through the
valley of the Connecticut, and stop for a night at the taverns
which he will usually find at the end of each day&rsquo;s stage.
The bedchamber into which he will be ushered will be the
concentration of all forms of bad air. The house is redolent
of the vegetables in the cellar,&mdash;cabbages, turnips, and
potatoes; and this fragrance is confined and retained by the
custom of closing the window blinds and dropping the inside
curtains, so that neither air nor sunshine enters in to purify.
Add to this the strong odor of a new feather bed and pillows,
and you have a combination of perfumes most appalling
to a delicate sense. Yet travelers take possession of these
rooms, sleep in them all night without raising the window
or opening the blinds, and leave them to be shut up for
other travelers.</p>
<p>The spare chamber of many dwellings seems to be an
hermetically closed box, opened only twice a year, for spring
and fall cleaning; but for the rest of the time closed to the
sun and the air of heaven. Thrifty country housekeepers
often adopt the custom of making their beds on the instant
after they are left, without airing the sheets and mattresses;
and a bed so made gradually becomes permeated with the
insensible emanations of the human body, so as to be a
steady corrupter of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the winter, the windows are calked and listed, the
throat of the chimney built up with a tight brick wall, and
a close stove is introduced to help burn out the vitality of
the air. In a sitting-room like this, from five to ten persons
will spend about eight months of the year, with no other
ventilation than that gained by the casual opening and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
shutting of doors. Is it any wonder that consumption every
year sweeps away its thousands?&mdash;that people are suffering
constant chronic ailments,&mdash;neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia,
and all the host of indefinite bad feelings that rob life of
sweetness and flower and bloom?</p>
<p>A recent writer raises the inquiry, whether the community
would not gain in health by the demolition of all dwelling-houses.
That is, he suggests the question, whether the
evils from foul air are not so great and so constant that
they countervail the advantages of shelter. Consumptive
patients far gone have been known to be cured by long
journeys, which have required them to be day and night in
the open air. Sleep under the open heaven, even though
the person be exposed to the various accidents of weather,
has often proved a miraculous restorer after everything else
had failed. But surely, if simple fresh air is so healing and
preserving a thing, some means might be found to keep the
air in a house just as pure and vigorous as it is outside.</p>
<p>An article in the May number of &ldquo;Harpers&rsquo; Magazine&rdquo;
presents drawings of a very simple arrangement by which
any house can be made thoroughly self-ventilating. Ventilation,
as this article shows, consists in two things,&mdash;a
perfect and certain expulsion from the dwelling of all foul
air breathed from the lungs or arising from any other cause,
and the constant supply of pure air.</p>
<p>One source of foul air cannot be too much guarded
against,&mdash;we mean imperfect gas-pipes. A want of thoroughness
in execution is the sin of our American artisans,
and very few gas-fixtures are so thoroughly made that more
or less gas does not escape and mingle with the air of the
dwelling. There are parlors where plants cannot be made
to live, because the gas kills them; and yet their occupants
do not seem to reflect that an air in which a plant cannot
live must be dangerous for a human being. The very clemency
and long-suffering of Nature to those who persistently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
violate her laws is one great cause why men are, physically
speaking, such sinners as they are. If foul air poisoned at
once and completely, we should have well-ventilated houses,
whatever else we failed to have. But because people can
go on for weeks, months, and years breathing poisons, and
slowly and imperceptibly lowering the tone of their vital
powers, and yet be what they call &ldquo;pretty well, I thank
you,&rdquo; sermons on ventilation and fresh air go by them as
an idle song. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but we are well enough, and
we never took much pains about these things. There&rsquo;s
air enough gets into houses, of course. What with doors
opening and windows occasionally lifted, the air of houses is
generally good enough;&rdquo;&mdash;and so the matter is dismissed.</p>
<p>One of Heaven&rsquo;s great hygienic teachers is now abroad in
the world, giving lessons on health to the children of men.
The cholera is like the angel whom God threatened to send
as leader to the rebellious Israelites. &ldquo;Beware of him, obey
his voice, and provoke him not; for he will not pardon your
transgressions.&rdquo; The advent of this fearful messenger seems
really to be made necessary by the contempt with which
men treat the physical laws of their being. What else could
have purified the dark places of New York? What a
wiping-up and reforming and cleansing is going before him
through the country! At last we find that Nature is in
earnest, and that her laws cannot be always ignored with
impunity. Poisoned air is recognized at last as an evil,&mdash;even
although the poison cannot be weighed, measured, or
tasted; and if all the precautions that men are now willing
to take could be made perpetual, the alarm would be a blessing
to the world.</p>
<p>Like the principles of spiritual religion, the principles of
physical religion are few and easy to be understood. An
old medical apothegm personifies the hygienic forces as the
Doctors Air, Diet, Exercise, and Quiet: and these four will
be found, on reflection, to cover the whole ground of what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
is required to preserve human health. A human being
whose lungs have always been nourished by pure air, whose
stomach has been fed only by appropriate food, whose muscles
have been systematically trained by appropriate exercises,
and whose mind is kept tranquil by faith in God and
a good conscience, has perfect physical religion. There is
a line where physical religion must necessarily overlap spiritual
religion and rest upon it. No human being can be
assured of perfect health, through all the strain and wear
and tear of such cares and such perplexities as life brings,
without the rest of faith in God. An unsubmissive, unconfiding,
unresigned soul will make vain the best hygienic
treatment; and, on the contrary, the most saintly religious
resolution and purpose may be defeated and vitiated by an
habitual ignorance and disregard of the laws of the physical
system.</p>
<p>Perfect spiritual religion cannot exist without perfect
physical religion. Every flaw and defect in the bodily system
is just so much taken from the spiritual vitality: we
are commanded to glorify God, not simply in our spirits,
but in our bodies and spirits. The only example of perfect
manhood the world ever saw impresses us more than anything
else by an atmosphere of perfect healthiness. There
is a calmness, a steadiness, in the character of Jesus, a naturalness
in his evolution of the sublimest truths under the
strain of the most absorbing and intense excitement, that
could come only from the one perfectly trained and developed
body, bearing as a pure and sacred shrine the One
Perfect Spirit. Jesus of Nazareth, journeying on foot from
city to city, always calm yet always fervent, always steady
yet glowing with a white heat of sacred enthusiasm, able to
walk and teach all day and afterwards to continue in prayer
all night, with unshaken nerves, sedately patient, serenely
reticent, perfectly self-controlled, walked the earth, the only
man that perfectly glorified God in His body no less than in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
His spirit. It is worthy of remark, that in choosing His
disciples He chose plain men from the laboring classes, who
had lived the most obediently to the simple, unperverted
laws of nature. He chose men of good and pure bodies,&mdash;simple,
natural, childlike, healthy men,&mdash;and baptized their
souls with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The hygienic bearings of the New Testament have never
been sufficiently understood. The basis of them lies in the
solemn declaration, that our bodies are to be temples of the
Holy Spirit, and that all abuse of them is of the nature of
sacrilege. Reverence for the physical system, as the outward
shrine and temple of the spiritual, is the peculiarity of
the Christian religion. The doctrine of the resurrection of
the body, and its physical immortality, sets the last crown
of honor upon it. That bodily system which God declared
worthy to be gathered back from the dust of the grave, and
re-created, as the soul&rsquo;s immortal companion, must necessarily
be dear and precious in the eyes of its Creator. The
one passage in the New Testament in which it is spoken of
disparagingly is where Paul contrasts it with the brighter
glory of what is to come: &ldquo;He shall change our vile bodies,
that they may be fashioned like his glorious body.&rdquo; From
this passage has come abundance of reviling of the physical
system. Memoirs of good men are full of abuse of it, as the
clog, the load, the burden, the chain. It is spoken of as
pollution, as corruption,&mdash;in short, one would think that
the Creator had imitated the cruelty of some Oriental despots
who have been known to chain a festering corpse to a living
body. Accordingly, the memoirs of these pious men are
also mournful records of slow suicide, wrought by the persistent
neglect of the most necessary and important laws of
the bodily system; and the body, outraged and downtrodden,
has turned traitor to the soul, and played the adversary
with fearful power. Who can tell the countless temptations
to evil which flow in from a neglected, disordered, deranged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
nervous system,&mdash;temptations to anger, to irritability, to
selfishness, to every kind of sin of appetite and passion?
No wonder that the poor soul longs for the hour of release
from such a companion.</p>
<p>But that human body which God declares expressly was
made to be the temple of the Holy Spirit, which he considers
worthy to be perpetuated by a resurrection and an
immortal existence, cannot be intended to be a clog and a
hindrance to spiritual advancement. A perfect body, working
in perfect tune and time, would open glimpses of happiness
to the soul approaching the joys we hope for in
heaven. It is only through the images of things which our
bodily senses have taught us, that we can form any conception
of that future bliss; and the more perfect these senses,
the more perfect our conceptions must be.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the whole matter, and the practical
application of this sermon, is,&mdash;First, that all men set
themselves to form the idea of what perfect health is, and
resolve to realize it for themselves and their children.
Second, that with a view to this they study the religion of
the body, in such simple and popular treatises as those of
George Combe, Dr. Dio Lewis, and others, and with simple
and honest hearts practice what they there learn.
Third, that the training of the bodily system should form a
regular part of our common-school education,&mdash;every common
school being provided with a well-instructed teacher
of gymnastics; and the growth and development of each
pupil&rsquo;s body being as much noticed and marked as is now
the growth of his mind. The same course should be continued
and enlarged in colleges and female seminaries, which
should have professors of hygiene appointed to give thorough
instruction concerning the laws of health.</p>
<p>And when this is all done, we may hope that crooked
spines, pimpled faces, sallow complexions, stooping shoulders,
and all other signs indicating an undeveloped physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
vitality, will, in the course of a few generations, disappear
from the earth, and men will have bodies which will
glorify God, their great Architect.</p>
<p>The soul of man has got as far as it can without the
body. Religion herself stops and looks back, waiting for
the body to overtake her. The soul&rsquo;s great enemy and
hindrance can be made her best friend and most powerful
help; and it is high time that this era were begun.
We old sinners, who have lived carelessly, and almost
spent our day of grace, may not gain much of its good; but
the children,&mdash;shall there not be a more perfect day for
them? Shall there not come a day when the little child,
whom Christ set forth to his disciples as the type of the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven, shall be the type no less
of our physical than our spiritual advancement,&mdash;when men
and women shall arise, keeping through long and happy
lives the simple, unperverted appetites, the joyous freshness
of spirit, the keen delight in mere existence, the dreamless
sleep and happy waking of early childhood?</p>

<h3>VII <br /><br />HOW SHALL WE ENTERTAIN OUR COMPANY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;we must have a party.
Bob don&rsquo;t like to hear of it, but it must come. We are in
debt to everybody: we have been invited everywhere, and
never had anything like a party since we were married, and
it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, I hate parties,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;They put
your house all out of order, give all the women a sick-headache,
and all the men an indigestion; you never see anybody
to any purpose; the girls look bewitched, and the
women answer you at cross-purposes, and call you by the
name of your next-door neighbor, in their agitation of mind.
We stay out beyond our usual bedtime, come home and
find some baby crying, or child who has been sitting up till
nobody knows when; and the next morning, when I must
be at my office by eight, and wife must attend to her children,
we are sleepy and headachy. I protest against making
overtures to entrap some hundred of my respectable
married friends into this snare which has so often entangled
me. If I had my way, I would never go to another party;
and as to giving one&mdash;I suppose, since my empress has declared
her intentions, that I shall be brought into doing it;
but it shall be under protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, we must keep up society,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I insist on it,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t keeping up society.
What earthly thing do you learn about people by meeting
them in a general crush, where all are coming, going, laughing,
talking, and looking at each other? No person of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
common sense ever puts forth any idea he cares twopence
about, under such circumstances; all that is exchanged is a
certain set of commonplaces and platitudes which people
keep for parties, just as they do their kid gloves and finery.
Now there are our neighbors, the Browns. When they drop
in of an evening, she knitting, and he with the last article
in the paper, she really comes out with a great deal of
fresh, lively, earnest, original talk. We have a good time,
and I like her so much that it quite verges on loving; but
see her in a party, when she manifests herself over five
or six flounces of pink silk and a perfect egg-froth of tulle,
her head adorned with a thicket of crêped hair and roses,
and it is plain at first view that talking with her is quite
out of the question. What has been done to her head on
the outside has evidently had some effect within, for she is
no longer the Mrs. Brown you knew in her every-day dress,
but Mrs. Brown in a party state of mind, and too distracted
to think of anything in particular. She has a few words
that she answers to everything you say, as for example, &lsquo;Oh,
very!&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly!&rsquo; &lsquo;How extraordinary!&rsquo; &lsquo;So happy to,&rsquo;
etc. The fact is, that she has come into a state in which
any real communication with her mind and character must
be suspended till the party is over and she is rested. Now
I like society, which is the reason why I hate parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;what are we to do?
Everybody can&rsquo;t drop in to spend an evening with you. If
it were not for these parties, there are quantities of your
acquaintances whom you would never meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of what use is it to meet them? Do you really
know them any better for meeting them got up in unusual
dresses, and sitting down together when the only thing exchanged
is the remark that it is hot or cold, or it rains, or
it is dry, or any other patent surface-fact that answers the
purpose of making believe you are talking when neither of
you is saying a word?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, for my part,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I confess I
like parties: they amuse me. I come home feeling kinder and
better to people, just for the little I see of them when they
are all dressed up and in good humor with themselves. To
be sure we don&rsquo;t say anything very profound,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
the most of us have anything profound to say; but I ask
Mrs. Brown where she buys her lace, and she tells me how she
washes it, and somebody else tells me about her baby, and
promises me a new sack-pattern. Then I like to see the
pretty, nice young girls flirting with the nice young men;
and I like to be dressed up a little myself, even if my finery
is all old and many times made over. It does me good to
be rubbed up and brightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like old silver,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, like old silver, precisely; and even if I do come
home tired, it does my mind good to have that change of
scene and faces. You men do not know what it is to be
tied to house and nursery all day, and what a perfect weariness
and lassitude it often brings on us women. For my
part I think parties are a beneficial institution of society,
and that it is worth a good deal of fatigue and trouble to
get one up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the expense,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;What earthly
need is there of a grand regale of oysters, chicken salad, ice-creams,
coffee, and champagne, between eleven and twelve
o&rsquo;clock at night, when no one of us would ever think of
wanting or taking any such articles upon our stomachs in
our own homes? If we were all of us in the habit of having
a regular repast at that hour, it might be well enough
to enjoy one with our neighbor; but the party fare is generally
just so much in addition to the honest three meals
which we have eaten during the day. Now, to spend from
fifty to one, two, or three hundred dollars in giving all our
friends an indigestion from a midnight meal seems to me a
very poor investment. Yet if we once begin to give the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
party, we must have everything that is given at the other
parties, or wherefore do we live? And caterers and waiters
rack their brains to devise new forms of expense and extravagance;
and when the bill comes in, one is sure to feel
that one is paying a great deal of money for a great deal of
nonsense. It is in fact worse than nonsense, because our dear
friends are, in half the cases, not only no better, but a great
deal worse, for what they have eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is this advantage to society,&rdquo; said Rudolph,&mdash;&ldquo;it
helps us young physicians. What would the physicians
do if parties were abolished? Take all the colds that are
caught by our fair friends with low necks and short sleeves,
all the troubles from dancing in tight dresses and inhaling
bad air, and all the headaches and indigestion from the
<i>mélange</i> of lobster salad, two or three kinds of ice-cream,
cake, and coffee on delicate stomachs, and our profession gets
a degree of encouragement that is worthy to be thought
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the question arises,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;whether there
are not ways of promoting social feeling less expensive, more
simple and natural and rational. I am inclined to think
that there are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Theophilus Thoro; &ldquo;for large parties are
not, as a general thing, given with any wish or intention
of really improving our acquaintance with our neighbors.
In many cases they are openly and avowedly a general tribute
paid at intervals to society, for and in consideration of
which you are to sit with closed blinds and doors and be
let alone for the rest of the year. Mrs. Bogus, for instance,
lives to keep her house in order, her closets locked, her
silver counted and in the safe, and her china-closet in undisturbed
order. Her &lsquo;best things&rsquo; are put away with such
admirable precision, in so many wrappings and foldings,
and secured with so many a twist and twine, that to get
them out is one of the seven labors of Hercules, not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
lightly or unadvisedly taken in hand, but reverently, discreetly,
and once for all, in an annual or biennial party. Then
says Mrs. Bogus, &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s have every creature
we can think of, and have &rsquo;em all over with at once.
For pity&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s have no driblets left that we shall have
to be inviting to dinner or to tea. No matter whether they
can come or not,&mdash;only send them the invitation, and our
part is done; and, thank Heaven! we shall be free for a
year.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my wife; &ldquo;a great stand-up party bears just
the same relation towards the offer of real hospitality and
good will as Miss Sally Brass&rsquo;s offer of meat to the little
hungry Marchioness, when, with a bit uplifted on the end
of a fork, she addressed her, &lsquo;Will you have this piece of
meat? No? Well, then, remember and don&rsquo;t say you
haven&rsquo;t had meat <i>offered</i> to you!&rsquo; You are invited to a
general jam, at the risk of your life and health; and if you
refuse, don&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t had hospitality offered to you.
All our debts are wiped out and our slate clean; now we
will have our own closed doors, no company and no trouble,
and our best china shall repose undisturbed on its shelves.
Mrs. Bogus says she never could exist in the way that Mrs.
Easygo does, with a constant drip of company,&mdash;two or three
to breakfast one day, half a dozen to dinner the next, and
little evening gatherings once or twice a week. It must keep
her house in confusion all the time; yet, for real social
feeling, real exchange of thought and opinion, there is more
of it in one half-hour at Mrs. Easygo&rsquo;s than in a dozen of
Mrs. Bogus&rsquo;s great parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, that Mrs. Easygo really does like the
society of human beings. She is genuinely and heartily
social; and, in consequence, though she has very limited
means, and no money to spend in giving great entertainments,
her domestic establishment is a sort of social exchange, where
more friendships are formed, more real acquaintance made,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
and more agreeable hours spent, than in any other place that
can be named. She never has large parties,&mdash;great general
pay-days of social debts,&mdash;but small, well-chosen circles of
people, selected so thoughtfully, with a view to the pleasure
which congenial persons give each other, as to make the
invitation an act of real personal kindness. She always
manages to have something for the entertainment of her
friends, so that they are not reduced to the simple alternative
of gaping at each other&rsquo;s dresses and eating lobster salad
and ice-cream. There is either some choice music, or a reading
of fine poetry, or a well-acted charade, or a portfolio
of photographs and pictures, to enliven the hour and start
conversation; and as the people are skillfully chosen with
reference to each other, as there is no hurry or heat or confusion,
conversation, in its best sense, can bubble up, fresh,
genuine, clear, and sparkling as a woodland spring, and one
goes away really rested and refreshed. The slight entertainment
provided is just enough to enable you to eat salt
together in Arab fashion,&mdash;not enough to form the leading
feature of the evening. A cup of tea and a basket of cake,
or a salver of ices, silently passed at quiet intervals, do not
interrupt conversation or overload the stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the art of society among us
Anglo-Saxons is yet in its rudest stages. We are not, as a
race, social and confiding, like the French and Italians and
Germans. We have a word for home, and our home is
often a moated grange, an island, a castle with its drawbridge
up, cutting us off from all but our own home-circle. In
France and Germany and Italy there are the boulevards and
public gardens, where people do their family living in common.
Mr. A. is breakfasting under one tree, with wife and
children around, and Mr. B. is breakfasting under another
tree, hard by; and messages, nods, and smiles pass backward
and forward. Families see each other daily in these public
resorts, and exchange mutual offices of good will. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
from these customs of society come that naïve simplicity and
abandon which one remarks in the Continental, in opposition
to the Anglo-Saxon, habits of conversation. A Frenchman
or an Italian will talk to you of his feeling and plans
and prospects with an unreserve that is perfectly unaccountable
to you, who have always felt that such things must be
kept for the very innermost circle of home privacy. But the
Frenchman or Italian has from a child been brought up to
pass his family life in places of public resort, in constant
contact and intercommunion with other families; and the
social and conversational instinct has thus been daily strengthened.
Hence the reunions of these people have been characterized
by a sprightliness and vigor and spirit that the
Anglo-Saxon has in vain attempted to seize and reproduce.
English and American <i>conversazioni</i> have very generally
proved a failure, from the rooted, frozen habit of reticence
and reserve which grows with our growth and strengthens
with our strength. The fact is, that the Anglo-Saxon race
as a race does not enjoy talking, and, except in rare instances,
does not talk well. A daily convocation of people, without
refreshments or any extraneous object but the simple pleasure
of seeing and talking with each other, is a thing that
can scarcely be understood in English or American society.
Social entertainment presupposes in the Anglo-Saxon mind
something to eat, and not only something, but a great deal.
Enormous dinners or great suppers constitute the entertainment.
Nobody seems to have formed the idea that the talking&mdash;the
simple exchange of social feelings&mdash;is, of itself,
the entertainment, and that being together is the pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Rocamier for years had a circle of friends who
met every afternoon in her salon from four to six o&rsquo;clock,
for the simple and sole pleasure of talking with each other.
The very first wits and men of letters and statesmen and
savans were enrolled in it, and each brought to the entertainment
some choice morceau which he had laid aside from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
his own particular field to add to the feast. The daily intimacy
gave each one such perfect insight into all the others&rsquo;
habits of thought, tastes, and preferences, that the conversation
was like the celebrated music of the Conservatoire in
Paris, a concert of perfectly chorded instruments taught by
long habit of harmonious intercourse to keep exact time and
tune together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real conversation presupposes intimate acquaintance.
People must see each other often enough to wear off the
rough bark and outside rind of commonplaces and conventionalities
in which their real ideas are enwrapped, and
give forth without reserve their innermost and best feelings.
Now what is called a large party is the first and rudest
form of social intercourse. The most we can say of it is,
that it is better than nothing. Men and women are crowded
together like cattle in a pen. They look at each other,
they jostle each other, exchange a few common bleatings,
and eat together; and so the performance terminates. One
may be crushed evening after evening against men or women,
and learn very little about them. You may decide
that a lady is good-tempered, when any amount of trampling
on the skirt of her new silk dress brings no cloud to
her brow. But <i>is</i> it good temper, or only wanton carelessness,
which cares nothing for waste? You can see that a
man is not a gentleman who squares his back to ladies at
the supper-table, and devours boned turkey and <i>paté de foie
gras</i>, while they vainly reach over and around him for
something, and that another is a gentleman so far as to prefer
the care of his weaker neighbors to the immediate indulgence
of his own appetites; but further than this you
learn little. Sometimes, it is true, in some secluded corner,
two people of fine nervous system, undisturbed by the general
confusion, may have a sociable half-hour, and really
part feeling that they like each other better, and know
more of each other than before. Yet these general gatherings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
have, after all, their value. They are not so good as
something better would be, but they cannot be wholly dispensed
with. It is far better that Mrs. Bogus should give
an annual party, when she takes down all her bedsteads
and throws open her whole house, than that she should
never see her friends and neighbors inside her doors at all.
She may feel that she has neither the taste nor the talent
for constant small reunions. Such things, she may feel,
require a social tact which she has not. She would be utterly
at a loss how to conduct them. Each one would cost
her as much anxiety and thought as her annual gathering,
and prove a failure after all; whereas the annual demonstration
can be put wholly into the hands of the caterer, who
comes in force, with flowers, silver, china, servants, and,
taking the house into his own hands, gives her entertainment
for her, leaving to her no responsibility but the payment
of the bills; and if Mr. Bogus does not quarrel with
them, we know no reason why any one else should; and I
think Mrs. Bogus merits well of the republic, for doing
what she can do towards the hospitalities of the season.
I&rsquo;m sure I never cursed her in my heart, even when her
strong coffee has held mine eyes open till morning, and
her superlative lobster salads have given me the very darkest
views of human life that ever dyspepsia and east wind
could engender. Mrs. Bogus is the Eve who offers the
apple; but after all, I am the foolish Adam who take and
eat what I know is going to hurt me, and I am too gallant
to visit my sins on the head of my too obliging tempter.
In country places in particular, where little is going on and
life is apt to stagnate, a good, large, generous party, which
brings the whole neighborhood into one house to have a jolly
time, to eat, drink, and be merry, is really quite a work of
love and mercy. People see one another in their best
clothes, and that is something; the elders exchange all manner
of simple pleasantries and civilities, and talk over their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
domestic affairs, while the young people flirt, in that wholesome
manner which is one of the safest of youthful follies.
A country party, in fact, may be set down as a work of benevolence,
and the money expended thereon fairly charged
to the account of the great cause of peace and good will on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that, if the
charge of providing the entertainment were less laborious,
these gatherings could be more frequent? You see, if
a woman feels that she must have five kinds of cake, and
six kinds of preserves, and even ice-cream and jellies in a
region where no confectioner comes in to abbreviate her
labors, she will sit with closed doors, and do nothing towards
the general exchange of life, because she cannot do
as much as Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Parsons. If the idea of
meeting together had some other focal point than eating,
I think there would be more social feeling. It might be a
musical reunion, where the various young people of a circle
agreed to furnish each a song or an instrumental performance.
It might be an impromptu charade party, bringing
out something of that taste in arrangement of costume, and
capacity for dramatic effect, of which there is more latent
in society than we think. It might be the reading of articles
in prose and poetry furnished to a common paper or
portfolio, which would awaken an abundance of interest
and speculation on the authorship, or it might be dramatic
readings and recitations. Any or all of these pastimes might
make an evening so entertaining that a simple cup of tea
and a plate of cake or biscuit would be all the refreshment
needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may with advantage steal a leaf now and then from
some foreign book,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;In France and Italy, families
have their peculiar days set apart for the reception of
friends at their own houses. The whole house is put upon
a footing of hospitality and invitation, and the whole mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
is given to receiving the various friends. In the evening
the salon is filled. The guests, coming from week to week,
for years, become in time friends; the resort has the charm
of a home circle; there are certain faces that you are always
sure to meet there. A lady once said to me of a certain
gentleman and lady whom she missed from her circle,
&lsquo;They have been at our house every Wednesday evening
for twenty years.&rsquo; It seems to me that this frequency of
meeting is the great secret of agreeable society. One sees,
in our American life, abundance of people who are everything
that is charming and cultivated, but one never sees
enough of them. One meets them at some quiet reunion,
passes a delightful hour, thinks how charming they are,
and wishes one could see more of them. But the pleasant
meeting is like the encounter of two ships in mid-ocean:
away we sail, each on his respective course, to see each
other no more till the pleasant remembrance has died away.
Yet were there some quiet, home-like resort where we
might turn in to renew from time to time the pleasant intercourse,
to continue the last conversation, and to compare
anew our readings and our experiences, the pleasant hour
of liking would ripen into a warm friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in order that this may be made possible and practicable,
the utmost simplicity of entertainment must prevail.
In a French salon all is to the last degree informal.
The <i>bouilloire</i>, the French tea-kettle, is often tended by
one of the gentlemen, who aids his fair neighbors in the
mysteries of tea-making. One nymph is always to be found
at the table dispensing tea and talk; and a basket of simple
biscuit and cakes, offered by another, is all the further repast.
The teacups and cake-basket are a real addition to the scene,
because they cause a little lively social bustle, a little chatter
and motion,&mdash;always of advantage in breaking up stiffness,
and giving occasion for those graceful, airy nothings
that answer so good a purpose in facilitating acquaintance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more charming than the description
which Edmond About gives, in his novel of &lsquo;Tolla,&rsquo; of the
reception evenings of an old noble Roman family,&mdash;the
spirit of repose and quietude through all the apartments;
the ease of coming and going; the perfect home-like spirit
in which the guests settle themselves to any employment
of the hour that best suits them: some to lively chat,
some to dreamy, silent lounging, some to a game, others in
a distant apartment to music, and others still to a promenade
along the terraces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is often in a state of mind and nerves which indisposes
for the effort of active conversation; one wishes to
rest, to observe, to be amused without an effort; and a
mansion which opens wide its hospitable arms, and offers
itself to you as a sort of home, where you may rest, and do
just as the humor suits you, is a perfect godsend at such
times. You are at home there, your ways are understood,
you can do as you please,&mdash;come early or late, be brilliant
or dull,&mdash;you are always welcome. If you can do nothing
for the social whole to-night, it matters not. There are
many more nights to come in the future, and you are entertained
on trust, without a challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one friend,&mdash;a man of genius, subject to the
ebbs and flows of animal spirits which attend that organization.
Of general society he has a nervous horror. A
regular dinner or evening party is to him a terror, an impossibility;
but there is a quiet parlor where stands a
much-worn old sofa, and it is his delight to enter without
knocking, and be found lying with half-shut eyes on this
friendly couch, while the family life goes on around him
without a question. Nobody is to mind him, to tease him
with inquiries or salutations. If he will, he breaks into
the stream of conversation, and sometimes, rousing up from
one of these dreamy trances, finds himself, ere he or they
know how, in the mood for free and friendly talk. People
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
often wonder, &lsquo;How do you catch So-and-so? He is so
shy! I have invited and invited, and he never comes.&rsquo;
We never invite, and he comes. We take no note of his
coming or his going; we do not startle his entrance with
acclamation, nor clog his departure with expostulation; it
is fully understood that with us he shall do just as he
chooses; and so he chooses to do much that we like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sum of this whole doctrine of society is, that we
are to try the value of all modes and forms of social entertainment
by their effect in producing real acquaintance and
real friendship and good will. The first and rudest form
of seeking this is by a great promiscuous party, which simply
effects this,&mdash;that people at least see each other on
the outside, and eat together. Next come all those various
forms of reunion in which the entertainment consists of something
higher than staring and eating,&mdash;some exercise of
the faculties of the guests in music, acting, recitation, reading,
etc.; and these are a great advance, because they show
people what is in them, and thus lay a foundation for a
more intelligent appreciation and acquaintance. These are
the best substitute for the expense, show, and trouble of
large parties. They are in their nature more refining and
intellectual. It is astonishing, when people really put together,
in some one club or association, all the different talents
for pleasing possessed by different persons, how clever
a circle may be gathered,&mdash;in the least promising neighborhood.
A club of ladies in one of our cities has had quite
a brilliant success. It is held every fortnight at the houses
of the members, according to alphabetical sequence. The
lady who receives has charge of arranging what the entertainment
shall be,&mdash;whether charade, tableau, reading,
recitation, or music; and the interest is much increased by
the individual taste shown in the choice of the diversion
and the variety which thence follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the summertime, in the country, open-air reunions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
are charming forms of social entertainment. Croquet parties,
which bring young people together by daylight for
a healthy exercise, and end with a moderate share of the
evening, are a very desirable amusement. What are called
&lsquo;lawn teas&rsquo; are finding great favor in England and some
parts of our country. They are simply an early tea enjoyed
in a sort of picnic style in the grounds about the house.
Such an entertainment enables one to receive a great many
at a time, without crowding, and, being in its very idea
rustic and informal, can be arranged with very little expense
or trouble. With the addition of lanterns in the trees
and a little music, this entertainment may be carried on far
into the evening with a very pretty effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to dancing, I have this much to say of it. Either
our houses must be all built over and made larger, or female
crinolines must be made smaller, or dancing must continue
as it now is, the most absurd and ungraceful of all attempts
at amusement. The effort to execute round dances in the
limits of modern houses, in the prevailing style of dress, can
only lead to developments more startling than agreeable.
Dancing in the open air, on the shaven green of lawns, is a
pretty and graceful exercise, and there only can full sweep
be allowed for the present feminine toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English breakfast is an institution growing in favor
here, and rightfully, too; for a party of fresh, good-natured,
well-dressed people, assembled at breakfast on a summer
morning, is as nearly perfect a form of reunion as can be
devised. All are in full strength from their night&rsquo;s rest;
the hour is fresh and lovely, and they are in condition to
give each other the very cream of their thoughts, the first
keen sparkle of the uncorked nervous system. The only
drawback is that, in our busy American life, the most desirable
gentlemen often cannot spare their morning hours.
Breakfast parties presuppose a condition of leisure; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
when they can be compassed, they are perhaps the most
perfectly enjoyable of entertainments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;I begin to waver about my
party. I don&rsquo;t know, after all, but the desire of paying off
social debts prompted the idea; perhaps we might try some
of the agreeable things suggested. But, dear me! there&rsquo;s
the baby. We&rsquo;ll finish the talk some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VIII <br /><br />HOW SHALL WE BE AMUSED</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four,&mdash;this makes the fifth accident
on the Fourth of July, in the two papers I have just read,&rdquo;
said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very moderate allowance,&rdquo; said Theophilus Thoro,
&ldquo;if you consider the Fourth as a great national saturnalia,
in which every boy in the land has the privilege of doing
whatever is right in his own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor boys!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowfield. &ldquo;All the
troubles of the world are laid at their door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;they did burn the city of Portland,
it appears. The fire arose from firecrackers, thrown by
boys among the shavings of a carpenter&rsquo;s shop,&mdash;so says
the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Rudolph, &ldquo;we surgeons expect a harvest of
business from the Fourth, as surely as from a battle. Certain
to be woundings, fractures, possibly amputations, following
the proceedings of our glorious festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why cannot we Americans learn to amuse ourselves
peaceably like other nations?&rdquo; said Bob Stephens. &ldquo;In
France and Italy, the greatest national festivals pass off
without fatal accident, or danger to any one. The fact is,
in our country we have not learned <i>how to be amused</i>.
Amusement has been made of so small account in our philosophy
of life, that we are raw and unpracticed in being
amused. Our diversions, compared with those of the
politer nations of Europe, are coarse and savage,&mdash;and consist
mainly in making disagreeable noises and disturbing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
peace of the community by rude uproar. The only idea
an American boy associates with the Fourth of July is that
of gunpowder in some form, and a wild liberty to fire off
pistols in all miscellaneous directions, and to throw firecrackers
under the heels of horses, and into crowds of women
and children, for the fun of seeing the stir and commotion
thus produced. Now take a young Parisian boy and give
him a fête, and he conducts himself with greater gentleness
and good breeding, because he is part of a community in
which the art of amusement has been refined and perfected,
so that he has a thousand resources beyond the very obvious
one of making a great banging and disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Bob Stephens, &ldquo;the fact is, that our
grim old Puritan fathers set their feet down resolutely on
all forms of amusement; they would have stopped the
lambs from wagging their tails, and shot the birds for singing,
if they could have had their way; and in consequence
of it, what a barren, cold, flowerless life is our New England
existence! Life is all, as Mantalini said, one &lsquo;demd
horrid grind.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing here but working and going to
church,&rsquo; said the German emigrants,&mdash;and they were about
right. A French traveler, in the year 1837, says that
attending the Thursday-evening lectures and church prayer-meetings
was the only recreation of the young people of
Boston; and we can remember the time when this really was
no exaggeration. Think of that, with all the seriousness
of our Boston east winds to give it force, and fancy the provision
for amusement in our society! The consequence is,
that boys who have the longing for amusement strongest
within them, and plenty of combativeness to back it, are
the standing terror of good society, and our Fourth of July
is a day of fear to all invalids and persons of delicate nervous
organization, and of real, appreciable danger of life and
limb to every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Robert,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;though I agree with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
you as to the actual state of society in this respect, I must
enter my protest against your slur on the memory of our
Pilgrim fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Theophilus Thoro, &ldquo;the New Englanders
are the only people, I believe, who take delight in vilifying
their ancestry. Every young hopeful in our day makes a
target of his grandfather&rsquo;s gravestone, and fires away, with
great self-applause. People in general seem to like to show
that they are well-born, and come of good stock; but the
young New Englanders, many of them, appear to take
pleasure in insisting that they came of a race of narrow-minded,
persecuting bigots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, that our Puritan fathers saw not everything.
They made a state where there were no amusements, but
where people could go to bed and leave their house doors
wide open all night, without a shadow of fear or danger, as
was for years the custom in all our country villages. The
fact is, that the simple early New England life, before we began
to import foreigners, realized a state of society in whose
possibility Europe would scarcely believe. If our fathers
had few amusements, they needed few. Life was too really
and solidly comfortable and happy to need much amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over the countries where people are most sedulously
amused by their rulers and governors. Are they not
the countries where the people are most oppressed, most unhappy
in their circumstances, and therefore in greatest need
of amusement? It is the slave who dances and sings, and
why? Because he owns nothing, and can own nothing,
and may as well dance and forget the fact. But give the
slave a farm of his own, a wife of his own, and children of
his own, with a schoolhouse and a vote, and ten to one he
dances no more. He needs no amusement, because he is
happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The legislators of Europe wished nothing more than to
bring up a people who would be content with amusements,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
and not ask after their rights or think too closely how they
were governed. &lsquo;Gild the dome of the Invalides,&rsquo; was
Napoleon&rsquo;s scornful prescription, when he heard the Parisian
population were discontented. They gilded it, and
the people forgot to talk about anything else. They were
a childish race, educated from the cradle on spectacle and
show, and by the sight of their eyes could they be governed.
The people of Boston, in 1776, could not have
been managed in this way, chiefly because they were brought
up in the strict schools of the fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;that something
might be added and amended in the state of society our
fathers established here in New England? Without becoming
frivolous, there might be more attention paid to
rational amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;the State and the Church
both might take a lesson from the providence of foreign
governments, and make liberty, to say the least, as attractive
as despotism. It is a very unwise mother that does
not provide her children with playthings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;the only thing that the Church
has yet done is to forbid and to frown. We have abundance
of tracts against dancing, whist-playing, ninepins,
billiards, operas, theatres,&mdash;in short, anything that young
people would be apt to like. The General Assembly of
the Presbyterian Church refused to testify against slavery,
because of political diffidence, but made up for it by ordering
a more stringent crusade against dancing. The theatre
and opera grow up and exist among us like plants on the
windy side of a hill, blown all awry by a constant blast of
conscientious rebuke. There is really no amusement young
people are fond of, which they do not pursue, in a sort of
defiance of the frown of the peculiarly religious world.
With all the telling of what the young shall <i>not</i> do, there
has been very little telling what they shall do.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The whole department of amusements&mdash;certainly one
of the most important in education&mdash;has been by the
Church made a sort of outlaws&rsquo; ground, to be taken possession
of and held by all sorts of spiritual ragamuffins; and
then the faults and shortcomings resulting from this arrangement
have been held up and insisted on as reasons why no
Christian should ever venture into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Church would set herself to amuse her young
folks, instead of discussing doctrines and metaphysical hair-splitting,
she would prove herself a true mother, and not
a hard-visaged stepdame. Let her keep this department,
so powerful and so difficult to manage, in what are morally
the strongest hands, instead of giving it up to the weakest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, if the different churches of a city, for example,
would rent a building where there should be a billiard-table,
one or two ninepin-alleys, a reading-room, a garden and
grounds for ball playing or innocent lounging, that they
would do more to keep their young people from the ways of
sin than a Sunday-school could. Nay, more: I would go
further. I would have a portion of the building fitted up
with scenery and a stage, for the getting up of tableaux or
dramatic performances, and thus give scope for the exercise
of that histrionic talent of which there is so much lying
unemployed in society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young people do not like amusements any better for
the wickedness connected with them. The spectacle of a
sweet little child singing hymns, and repeating prayers, of
a pious old Uncle Tom dying for his religion, has filled
theatres night after night, and proved that there really is
no need of indecent or improper plays to draw full houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things that draw young people to places of amusement
are not at first gross things. Take the most notorious
public place in Paris,&mdash;the Jardin Mabille, for instance,&mdash;and
the things which give it its first charm are all innocent
and artistic. Exquisite beds of lilies, roses, gillyflowers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
lighted with jets of gas so artfully as to make every flower
translucent as a gem; fountains where the gaslight streams
out from behind misty wreaths of falling water and calla-blossoms;
sofas of velvet turf, canopied with fragrant
honeysuckle; dim bowers overarched with lilacs and roses;
a dancing-ground under trees whose branches bend with a
fruitage of many-colored lamps; enchanting music and
graceful motion; in all these there is not only no sin, but
they are really beautiful and desirable; and if they were
only used on the side and in the service of virtue and religion,
if they were contrived and kept up by the guardians
and instructors of youth, instead of by those whose interest
it is to demoralize and destroy, young people would have
no temptation to stray into the haunts of vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Prussia, under the reign of Frederick William II.,
when one good, hard-handed man governed the whole country
like a strict schoolmaster, the public amusements for
the people were made such as to present a model for all
states. The theatres were strictly supervised, and actors
obliged to conform to the rules of decorum and morality.
The plays and performances were under the immediate
supervision of men of grave morals, who allowed nothing
corrupting to appear; and the effect of this administration
and restraint is to be seen in Berlin even to this day. The
public gardens are full of charming little resorts, where,
every afternoon, for a very moderate sum, one can have
either a concert of good music, or a very fair dramatic or
operatic performance. Here whole families may be seen
enjoying together a wholesome and refreshing entertainment,&mdash;the
mother and aunts with their knitting, the baby, the
children of all ages, and the father,&mdash;their faces radiant
with that mild German light of contentment and good will
which one feels to be characteristic of the nation. When I
saw these things, and thought of our own outcast, unprovided
boys and young men, haunting the streets and alleys of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
cities, in places far from the companionship of mothers and
sisters, I felt as if it would be better for a nation to be
brought up by a good strict schoolmaster king than to try
to be a republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but the difficulty is to get the good
schoolmaster king. For one good shepherd, there are twenty
who use the sheep only for their flesh and their wool.
Republics can do all that kings can,&mdash;witness our late army
and sanitary commission. Once fix the idea thoroughly in
the public mind that there ought to be as regular and careful
provision for public amusement as there is for going
to church and Sunday-school, and it will be done. Central
Park in New York is a beginning in the right direction, and
Brooklyn is following the example of her sister city. There
is, moreover, an indication of the proper spirit in the increased
efforts that are made to beautify Sunday-school
rooms, and make them interesting, and to have Sunday-school
fêtes and picnics,&mdash;the most harmless and commendable
way of celebrating the Fourth of July. Why should
saloons and bar-rooms be made attractive by fine paintings,
choice music, flowers, and fountains, and Sunday-school
rooms be four bare walls? There are churches whose broad
aisles represent ten and twenty millions of dollars, and
whose sons and daughters are daily drawn to circuses,
operas, theatres, because they have tastes and feelings, in
themselves perfectly laudable and innocent, for the gratification
of which no provision is made in any other place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one church,&rdquo; said Rudolph, &ldquo;whose Sunday-school
room is as beautifully adorned as any haunt of sin.
There is a fountain in the centre, which plays into a basin
surrounded with shells and flowers; it has a small organ to
lead the children&rsquo;s voices, and the walls are hung with oil
paintings and engravings from the best masters. The festivals
of the Sabbath school, which are from time to time
held in this place, educate the taste of the children, as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
as amuse them; and, above all, they have through life the
advantage of associating with their early religious education
all those ideas of taste, elegance, and artistic culture which
too often come through polluted channels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the amusement of the young shall become the
care of the experienced and the wise, and the floods of
wealth that are now rolling over and over, in silent investments,
shall be put into the form of innocent and refined
pleasures for the children and youth of the state, our national
festivals may become days to be desired, and not
dreaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Fourth of July, our city fathers do in a certain
dim wise perceive that the public owes some attempt
at amusement to its children, and they vote large sums,
principally expended in bell-ringing, cannon, and fireworks.
The sidewalks are witness to the number who fall victims
to the temptations held out by grog-shops and saloons; and
the papers, for weeks after, are crowded with accounts of
accidents. Now, a yearly sum expended to keep up, and
keep pure, places of amusement which hold out no temptation
to vice, but which excel all vicious places in real beauty
and attractiveness, would greatly lessen the sum needed to
be expended on any one particular day, and would refine
and prepare our people to keep holidays and festivals appropriately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowfield, &ldquo;I am grieved at
the opprobrium which falls on the race of <i>boys</i>. Why
should the most critical era in the life of those who are to
be men, and to govern society, be passed in a sort of outlawry,&mdash;a
rude warfare with all existing institutions?
The years between ten and twenty are full of the nervous
excitability which marks the growth and maturing of the
manly nature. The boy feels wild impulses, which ought
to be vented in legitimate and healthful exercise. He
wants to run, shout, wrestle, ride, row, skate; and all these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
together are often not sufficient to relieve the need he feels
of throwing off the excitability that burns within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the wants of this period what safe provision is
made by the church, or by the state, or any of the boy&rsquo;s
lawful educators? In all the Prussian schools amusements
are as much a part of the regular school system as grammar
or geography. The teacher is with the boys on the playground,
and plays as heartily as any of them. The boy
has his physical wants anticipated. He is not left to fight
his way, blindly stumbling against society, but goes forward
in a safe path, which his elders and betters have marked
out for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our country, the boy&rsquo;s career is often a series of
skirmishes with society. He wants to skate, and contrives ingeniously
to dam the course of a brook and flood a meadow
which makes a splendid skating-ground. Great is the joy
for a season, and great the skating. But the water floods
the neighboring cellars. The boys are cursed through all
the moods and tenses,&mdash;boys are such a plague! The
dam is torn down with emphasis and execration. The
boys, however, lie in wait some cold night, between twelve
and one, and build it up again; and thus goes on the battle.
The boys care not whose cellar they flood, because
nobody cares for their amusement. They understand themselves
to be outlaws, and take an outlaw&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the boys have their sleds; and sliding down
hill is splendid fun. But they trip up some grave citizen,
who sprains his shoulder. What is the result? Not the
provision of a safe, good place, where boys <i>may</i> slide down
hill without danger to any one, but an edict forbidding all
sliding, under penalty of fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys want to swim: it is best they should swim; and
if city fathers, foreseeing and caring for this want, should
think it worth while to mark off some good place, and have
it under such police surveillance as to enforce decency of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
language and demeanor, they would prevent a great deal
that now is disagreeable in the unguided efforts of boys to
enjoy this luxury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be cheaper in the end, even if one had to
build sliding-piles, as they do in Russia, or to build skating-rinks,
as they do in Montreal,&mdash;it would be cheaper for
every city, town, and village to provide legitimate amusement
for boys, under proper superintendence, than to leave
them, as they are now left, to fight their way against society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the boys&rsquo; academies of our country, what provision
is made for amusement? There are stringent rules, and
any number of them, to prevent boys making any noise
that may disturb the neighbors; and generally the teacher
thinks that, if he keeps the boys <i>still</i>, and sees that they
get their lessons, his duty is done. But a hundred boys
ought not to be kept still. There ought to be noise and
motion among them, in order that they may healthily survive
the great changes which nature is working within
them. If they become silent, averse to movement, fond of
indoor lounging and warm rooms, they are going in far
worse ways than any amount of outward lawlessness could
bring them to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoking and yellow-covered novels are worse than
any amount of hullabaloo; and the quietest boy is often a
poor, ignorant victim, whose life is being drained out of him
before it is well begun. If mothers could only see the
series of books that are sold behind counters to boarding-school
boys, whom nobody warns and nobody cares for,&mdash;if
they could see the poison, going from pillow to pillow, in
books pretending to make clear the great, sacred mysteries
of our nature, but trailing them over with the filth of utter
corruption! These horrible works are the inward and secret
channel of hell, into which a boy is thrust by the pressure
of strict outward rules, forbidding that physical and out-of-door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
exercise and motion to which he ought rather to be
encouraged, and even driven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is melancholy to see that, while parents, teachers,
and churches make no provision for boys in the way of
amusement, the world, the flesh, and the devil are incessantly
busy and active in giving it to them. There are
ninepin-alleys, with cigars and a bar. There are billiard-saloons,
with a bar, and, alas! with the occasional company
of girls who are still beautiful, but who have lost the innocence
of womanhood, while yet retaining many of its charms.
There are theatres, with a bar, and with the society of lost
women. The boy comes to one and all of these places,
seeking only what is natural and proper he should have,&mdash;what
should be given him under the eye and by the care of
the Church, the school. He comes for exercise and amusement,&mdash;he
gets these, and a ticket to destruction besides,&mdash;and
whose fault is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the aspects of public life,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which
make me feel that we never shall have a perfect state till
women vote and bear rule equally with men. State housekeeping
has been, hitherto, like what any housekeeping would
be, conducted by the voice and knowledge of man alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If women had an equal voice in the management of our
public money, I have faith to believe that thousands which
are now wasted in mere political charlatanism would go to
provide for the rearing of the children of the state, male and
female. My wife has spoken for the boys; I speak for the
girls also. What is provided for their physical development
and amusement? Hot, gas-lighted theatric and operatic
performances, beginning at eight, and ending at midnight;
hot, crowded parties and balls; dancing with dresses tightly
laced over the laboring lungs,&mdash;these are almost the whole
story. I bless the advent of croquet and skating. And
yet the latter exercise, pursued as it generally is, is a most
terrible exposure. There is no kindly parental provision
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
for the poor, thoughtless, delicate young creature,&mdash;not
even the shelter of a dressing-room with a fire, at which she
may warm her numb fingers and put on her skates when she
arrives on the ground, and to which she may retreat in intervals
of fatigue; so she catches cold, and perhaps sows the
seed which with air-tight stoves and other appliances of hot-house
culture may ripen into consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What provision is there for the amusement of all the
shop girls, seamstresses, factory girls, that crowd our cities?
What for the thousands of young clerks and operatives?
Not long since, in a respectable old town in New England,
the body of a beautiful girl was drawn from the river in
which she had drowned herself,&mdash;a young girl only fifteen,
who came to the city, far from home and parents, and fell a
victim to the temptation which brought her to shame and desperation.
Many thus fall every year who are never counted.
They fall into the ranks of those whom the world abandons
as irreclaimable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let those who have homes and every appliance to make
life pass agreeably, and who yet yawn over an unoccupied
evening, fancy a lively young girl all day cooped up at sewing
in a close, ill-ventilated room. Evening comes, and she has
three times the desire for amusement and three times the
need of it that her fashionable sister has. And where can
she go? To the theatre, perhaps, with some young man as
thoughtless as herself, and more depraved; then to the bar
for a glass of wine, and another; and then, with a head
swimming and turning, who shall say where else she may
be led? Past midnight and no one to look after her,&mdash;and
one night ruins her utterly and for life, and she as yet only
a child!</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Newton had a very wise saying: &lsquo;Here is a man
trying to fill a bushel with chaff. Now if I fill it with
wheat first, it is better than to fight him.&rsquo; This apothegm
contains in it the whole of what I would say on the subject
of amusements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door of my study being open, I heard in the distant
parlor a sort of flutter of silken wings, and chatter
of bird-like voices, which told me that a covey of Jenny&rsquo;s
pretty young street birds had just alighted there. I could
not forbear a peep at the rosy faces that glanced out under
pheasants&rsquo; tails, doves&rsquo; wings, and nodding humming-birds,
and made one or two errands in that direction only that I
might gratify my eyes with a look at them.</p>
<p>Your nice young girl, of good family and good breeding,
is always a pretty object, and, for my part, I regularly lose
my heart (in a sort of figurative way) to every fresh, charming
creature that trips across my path. All their mysterious
rattletraps and whirligigs,&mdash;their curls and networks
and crimples and rimples and crisping-pins,&mdash;their little
absurdities, if you will,&mdash;have to me a sort of charm, like
the tricks and stammerings of a curly-headed child. I should
have made a very poor censor if I had been put in Cato&rsquo;s
place: the witches would have thrown all my wisdom into
some private chip-basket of their own, and walked off with
it in triumph. Never a girl bows to me that I do not see
in her eye a twinkle of confidence that she could, if she
chose, make an old fool of me. I surrender at discretion on
first sight.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s friends are nice girls,&mdash;the flowers of good,
staid, sensible families,&mdash;not heathen blossoms nursed in
the hot-bed heat of wild, high-flying, fashionable society.
They have been duly and truly taught and brought up, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
good mothers and painstaking aunties, to understand in their
infancy that handsome is that handsome does; that little
girls must not be vain of their pretty red shoes and nice
curls, and must remember that it is better to be good than
to be handsome; with all other wholesome truisms of the
kind. They have been to school, and had their minds
improved in all modern ways,&mdash;have calculated eclipses,
and read Virgil, Schiller, and La Fontaine, and understand
all about the geological strata, and the different systems of
metaphysics,&mdash;so that a person reading the list of their
acquirements might be a little appalled at the prospect of
entering into conversation with them. For all these reasons
I listened quite indulgently to the animated conversation
that was going on about&mdash;Well!</p>
<p>What <i>do</i> girls generally talk about, when a knot of them
get together? Not, I believe, about the sources of the
Nile, or the precession of the equinoxes, or the nature of
the human understanding, or Dante, or Shakespeare, or Milton,
although they have learned all about them in school;
but upon a theme much nearer and dearer,&mdash;the one all-pervading
feminine topic ever since Eve started the first
toilet of fig-leaves; and as I caught now and then a phrase
of their chatter, I jotted it down in pure amusement, giving
to each charming speaker the name of the bird under whose
colors she was sailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said little Humming-Bird, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite
worn out with sewing; the fashions are all <i>so</i> different
from what they were last year, that everything has to be
made over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful!&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my new
mauve silk dress! it was a very expensive silk, and I
haven&rsquo;t worn it more than three or four times, and it really
looks quite dowdy; and I can&rsquo;t get Patterson to do it over
for me for this party. Well, really, I shall have to give up
company because I have nothing to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who <i>does</i> set the fashions, I wonder,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird;
&ldquo;they seem nowadays to whirl faster and faster, till
really they don&rsquo;t leave one time for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dove, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a moment for reading, or
drawing, or keeping up my music. The fact is, nowadays,
to keep one&rsquo;s self properly dressed is all one can do. If I
were <i>grande dame</i> now, and had only to send an order to
my milliner and dressmaker, I might be beautifully dressed
all the time without giving much thought to it myself; and
that is what I should like. But this constant planning
about one&rsquo;s toilet, changing your buttons and your fringes
and your bonnet-trimmings and your hats every other day,
and then being behindhand! It is really too fatiguing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I never pretend to keep up. I
never expect to be in the front rank of fashion, but no girl
wants to be behind every one; nobody wants to have people
say, &lsquo;Do see what an old-times, rubbishy looking creature
<i>that</i> is.&rsquo; And now, with my small means and my conscience
(for I have a conscience in this matter, and don&rsquo;t
wish to spend any more time and money than is needed to
keep one&rsquo;s self fresh and tasteful), I find my dress quite a
fatiguing care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, girls,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;do you really
know, I have sometimes thought I should like to be a nun,
just to get rid of all this labor. If I once gave up dress
altogether, and knew I was to have nothing but one plain
robe tied round my waist with a cord, it does seem to me
as if it would be a perfect repose,&mdash;only one is a Protestant,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as Humming-Bird was the most notoriously dressy
individual in the little circle, this suggestion was received
with quite a laugh. But Dove took it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when dear Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; preaches
those saintly sermons to us about our baptismal vows, and
the nobleness of an unworldly life, and calls on us to live
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
for something purer and higher than we are living for, I
confess that sometimes all my life seems to me a mere sham,&mdash;that
I am going to church, and saying solemn words, and
being wrought up by solemn music, and uttering most solemn
vows and prayers, all to no purpose; and then I come away
and look at my life, all resolving itself into a fritter about
dress, and sewing-silk, cord, braid, and buttons,&mdash;the next
fashion of bonnets,&mdash;how to make my old dresses answer
instead of new,&mdash;how to keep the air of the world, while
in my heart I am cherishing something higher and better.
If there&rsquo;s anything I detest it is hypocrisy; and sometimes
the life I lead looks like it. But how to get out of it?&mdash;what
to do?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;that taking care of
my clothes and going into company is, frankly, all I do.
If I go to parties, as other girls do, and make calls, and
keep dressed,&mdash;you know papa is not rich, and one must
do these things economically,&mdash;it really does take all the
time I have. When I was confirmed the Bishop talked to
us so sweetly, and I really meant sincerely to be a good
girl,&mdash;to be as good as I knew how; but now, when they
talk about fighting the good fight and running the Christian
race, I feel very mean and little, for I am quite sure this
isn&rsquo;t doing it. But what is,&mdash;and who is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betsey Titcomb is doing it, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Pheasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betsey!&rdquo; said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;well, she is.
She spends all her money in doing good. She goes round
visiting the poor all the time. She is a perfect saint;&mdash;but
oh girls, how she looks! Well, now, I confess, when
I think I must look like Aunt Betsey, my courage gives
out. Is it necessary to go without hoops, and look like a
dipped candle, in order to be unworldly? Must one wear
such a fright of a bonnet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;I think not. I think Miss Betsey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
Titcomb, good as she is, injures the cause of goodness by
making it outwardly repulsive. I really think, if she would
take some pains with her dress, and spend upon her own
wardrobe a little of the money she gives away, that she
might have influence in leading others to higher aims; now
all her influence is against it. Her <i>outré</i> and repulsive exterior
arrays our natural and innocent feelings against goodness;
for surely it is natural and innocent to wish to look
well, and I am really afraid a great many of us are more
afraid of being thought ridiculous than of being wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; said Pheasant, &ldquo;you know Mr. St.
Clair says, &lsquo;Dress is one of the fine arts,&rsquo; and if it is, why
of course we ought to cultivate it. Certainly, well-dressed
men and women are more agreeable objects than rude and
unkempt ones. There must be somebody whose mission it
is to preside over the agreeable arts of life; and I suppose
it falls to &lsquo;us girls.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the way I comfort myself, at
all events. Then I must confess that I do like dress; I&rsquo;m
not cultivated enough to be a painter or a poet, and I have
all my artistic nature, such as it is, in dress. I love harmonies
of color, exact shades and matches; I love to see a
uniform idea carried all through a woman&rsquo;s toilet,&mdash;her
dress, her bonnet, her gloves, her shoes, her pocket-handkerchief
and cuffs, her very parasol, all in correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;anything of this kind
must take a fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I had a fortune, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I should spend
a good deal of it in this way,&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;I can imagine
such completeness of toilet as I have never seen. How
I would like the means to show what I could do! My life,
now, is perpetual disquiet. I always feel shabby. My
things must all be bought at haphazard, as they can be got
out of my poor little allowance,&mdash;and things are getting
so horridly dear! Only think of it, girls! gloves at two
and a quarter! and boots at seven, eight, and ten dollars!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
and then, as you say, the fashions changing so! Why, I
bought a sack last fall and gave forty dollars for it, and this
winter I&rsquo;m wearing it, to be sure, but it has no style at
all,&mdash;looks quite antiquated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I say,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;that you are really morbid
on the subject of dress; you are fastidious and particular
and exacting in your ideas in a way that really ought to be
put down. There is not a girl of our set that dresses as
nicely as you do, except Emma Seyton, and her father, you
know, has no end of income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Jenny,&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;I think I really
look like a beggar; but then, I bear it as well as I can,
because, you see, I know papa does all for us he can, and
I won&rsquo;t be extravagant. But I do think, as Humming-Bird
says, that it would be a great relief to give it up altogether
and retire from the world; or, as Cousin John says, climb
a tree and pull it up after you, and so be in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jenny, &ldquo;all this seems to have come on
since the war. It seems to me that not only has everything
doubled in price, but all the habits of the world seem to
require that you shall have double the quantity of everything.
Two or three years ago a good balmoral skirt was
a fixed fact; it was a convenient thing for sloppy, unpleasant
weather. But now, dear me! there is no end to them.
They cost fifteen and twenty dollars; and girls that I know
have one or two every season, besides all sorts of quilled
and embroidered and ruffled and tucked and flounced ones.
Then, in dressing one&rsquo;s hair, what a perfect overflow there
is of all manner of waterfalls, and braids, and rats, and mice,
and curls, and combs; when three or four years ago we
combed our own hair innocently behind our ears, and put
flowers in it, and thought we looked nicely at our evening
parties! I don&rsquo;t believe we look any better now, when we
are dressed, than we did then,&mdash;so what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you ever see such a tyranny as this of fashion?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
said Humming-Bird. &ldquo;We know it&rsquo;s silly, but we
all bow down before it; we are afraid of our lives before
it; and who makes all this and sets it going? The Paris
milliners, the Empress, or who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question where fashions come from is like the
question where pins go to,&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;Think of the
thousands and millions of pins that are being used every
year, and not one of them worn out. Where do they all
go to? One would expect to find a pin mine somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victor Hugo says they go into the sewers in Paris,&rdquo;
said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fashions come from a source about as pure,&rdquo;
said I, from the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, Jenny, do tell us if your father has been
listening to us all this time!&rdquo; was the next exclamation;
and forthwith there was a whir and rustle of the silken
wings, as the whole troop fluttered into my study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Crowfield, you are too bad!&rdquo; said Humming-Bird,
as she perched upon a corner of my study-table, and
put her little feet upon an old &ldquo;Froissart&rdquo; which filled
the armchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be listening to our nonsense!&rdquo; said Pheasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lying in wait for us!&rdquo; said Dove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, you have brought us all down on you,&rdquo;
said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t find it so easy to be
rid of us. You will have to answer all our questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears, I am at your service, as far as mortal man
may be,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;tell us all about
everything,&mdash;how things come to be as they are. Who
makes the fashions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is universally admitted that, in the matter
of feminine toilet, France rules the world,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who rules France?&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;Who decides
what the fashions shall be there?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is the great misfortune of the civilized world, at the
present hour,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the state of morals in France
is apparently at the very lowest ebb, and consequently the
leadership of fashion is entirely in the hands of a class of
women who could not be admitted into good society, in any
country. Women who can never have the name of wife,&mdash;who
know none of the ties of family,&mdash;these are the dictators
whose dress and equipage and appointments give the
law, first to France, and through France to the civilized
world. Such was the confession of Monsieur Dupin, made
in a late speech before the French Senate, and acknowledged,
with murmurs of assent on all sides, to be the truth.
This is the reason why the fashions have such an utter
disregard of all those laws of prudence and economy which
regulate the expenditures of families. They are made by
women whose sole and only hold on life is personal attractiveness,
and with whom to keep this up, at any cost, is a
desperate necessity. No moral quality, no association of
purity, truth, modesty, self-denial, or family love, comes in
to hallow the atmosphere about them, and create a sphere of
loveliness which brightens as mere physical beauty fades.
The ravages of time and dissipation must be made up by an
unceasing study of the arts of the toilet. Artists of all
sorts, moving in their train, rack all the stores of ancient
and modern art for the picturesque, the dazzling, the grotesque;
and so, lest these Circes of society should carry all
before them, and enchant every husband, brother, and lover,
the staid and lawful Penelopes leave the hearth and home
to follow in their triumphal march and imitate their arts.
Thus it goes in France; and in England, virtuous and domestic
princesses and peeresses must take obediently what
has been decreed by their rulers in the <i>demi-monde</i> of
France; and we in America have leaders of fashion, who
make it their pride and glory to turn New York into Paris,
and to keep even step with everything that is going on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
there. So the whole world of womankind is marching
under the command of those leaders. The love of dress
and glitter and fashion is getting to be a morbid, unhealthy
epidemic, which really eats away the nobleness and purity
of women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In France, as Monsieur Dupin, Edmond About, and
Michelet tell us, the extravagant demands of love for dress
lead women to contract debts unknown to their husbands,
and sign obligations which are paid by the sacrifice of
honor, and thus the purity of the family is continually
undermined. In England there is a voice of complaint,
sounding from the leading periodicals, that the extravagant
demands of female fashion are bringing distress into families,
and making marriages impossible; and something of
the same sort seems to have begun here. We are across
the Atlantic, to be sure; but we feel the swirl and drift
of the great whirlpool; only, fortunately, we are far enough
off to be able to see whither things are tending, and to stop
ourselves if we will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just come through a great struggle, in which
our women have borne an heroic part,&mdash;have shown themselves
capable of any kind of endurance and self-sacrifice;
and now we are in that reconstructive state which makes it
of the greatest consequence to ourselves and the world that
we understand our own institutions and position, and learn
that, instead of following the corrupt and worn-out ways of
the Old World, we are called on to set the example of a
new state of society,&mdash;noble, simple, pure, and religious;
and women can do more towards this even than men, for
women are the real architects of society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Viewed in this light, even the small, frittering cares of
women&rsquo;s life&mdash;the attention to buttons, trimmings, thread,
and sewing-silk&mdash;may be an expression of their patriotism
and their religion. A noble-hearted woman puts a noble
meaning into even the commonplace details of life. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
women of America can, if they choose, hold back their
country from following in the wake of old, corrupt, worn-out,
effeminate European society, and make America the
leader of the world in all that is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird, &ldquo;we all would like to
be noble and heroic. During the war, I did so long to be
a man! I felt so poor and insignificant because I was nothing
but a girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Pheasant, &ldquo;but then one wants to do
something worth doing, if one is going to do anything.
One would like to be grand and heroic, if one could; but
if not, why try at all? One wants to be <i>very</i> something,
<i>very</i> great, <i>very</i> heroic; or if not that, then at least very
stylish and very fashionable. It is this everlasting mediocrity
that bores me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I suppose, you agree with the man we read of,
who buried his one talent in the earth, as hardly worth
caring for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say the truth, I always had something of a sympathy
for that man,&rdquo; said Pheasant. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t enjoy goodness
and heroism in hom&oelig;opathic doses. I want something
appreciable. What I can do, being a woman, is a
very different thing from what I should try to do if I were
a man, and had a man&rsquo;s chances: it is so much less&mdash;so
poor&mdash;that it is scarcely worth trying for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the apothegm of one of the
old divines, that if two angels were sent down from heaven,
the one to govern a kingdom, and the other to sweep a
street, they would not feel any disposition to change
works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that just shows that they are angels, and not
mortals,&rdquo; said Pheasant; &ldquo;but we poor human beings see
things differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, my child, what could Grant or Sherman have
done, if it had not been for the thousands of brave privates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
who were content to do each their imperceptible little,&mdash;if
it had not been for the poor, unnoticed, faithful, never-failing
common soldiers, who did the work and bore the
suffering? No <i>one</i> man saved our country, or could save
it; nor could the men have saved it without the women.
Every mother that said to her son, Go; every wife that
strengthened the hands of her husband; every girl who
sent courageous letters to her betrothed; every woman who
worked for a fair; every grandam whose trembling hands
knit stockings and scraped lint; every little maiden who
hemmed shirts and made comfort-bags for soldiers,&mdash;each
and all have been the joint doers of a great heroic work, the
doing of which has been the regeneration of our era. A
whole generation has learned the luxury of thinking heroic
thoughts and being conversant with heroic deeds, and I
have faith to believe that all this is not to go out in a mere
crush of fashionable luxury and folly and frivolous emptiness,&mdash;but
that our girls are going to merit the high praise
given us by De Tocqueville, when he placed first among the
causes of our prosperity the <i>noble character of American
women</i>. Because foolish female persons in New York are
striving to outdo the <i>demi-monde</i> of Paris in extravagance,
it must not follow that every sensible and patriotic matron,
and every nice, modest young girl, must forthwith and
without inquiry rush as far after them as they possibly can.
Because Mrs. Shoddy opens a ball in a two-thousand-dollar
lace dress, every girl in the land need not look with shame
on her modest white muslin. Somewhere between the
fast women of Paris and the daughters of Christian American
families there should be established a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>,
to keep out the contagion of manners, customs, and habits
with which a noble-minded, religious democratic people
ought to have nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, Mr. Crowfield,&rdquo; said the Dove, &ldquo;since you
speak us so fair, and expect so much of us, we must of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
course try not to fall below your compliments; but, after
all, tell us what is the right standard about dress. Now
we have daily lectures about this at home. Aunt Maria
says that she never saw such times as these, when mothers
and daughters, church-members and worldly people, all
seem to be going one way, and sit down together and talk,
as they will, on dress and fashion,&mdash;how to have this made
and that altered. We used to be taught, she said, that
church-members had higher things to think of,&mdash;that their
thoughts ought to be fixed on something better, and that they
ought to restrain the vanity and worldliness of children and
young people; but now, she says, even before a girl is born,
dress is the one thing needful,&mdash;the great thing to be
thought of; and so, in every step of the way upward, her
little shoes, and her little bonnets, and her little dresses,
and her corals and her ribbons, are constantly being discussed
in her presence, as the one all-important object of
life. Aunt Maria thinks mamma is dreadful, because she has
maternal yearnings over our toilet successes and fortunes;
and we secretly think Aunt Maria is rather soured by old
age, and has forgotten how a girl feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the love of dress and outside
show has been always such an exacting and absorbing
tendency, that it seems to have furnished work for religionists
and economists, in all ages, to keep it within bounds.
Various religious bodies, at the outset, adopted severe rules
in protest against it. The Quakers and the Methodists prescribed
certain fixed modes of costume as a barrier against
its frivolities and follies. In the Romish Church an entrance
on any religious order prescribed entire and total
renunciation of all thought and care for the beautiful in
person or apparel, as the first step towards saintship. The
costume of the <i>religieuse</i> seemed to be purposely intended
to imitate the shroudings and swathings of a corpse and
the lugubrious color of a pall, so as forever to remind the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
wearer that she was dead to the world of ornament and
physical beauty. All great Christian preachers and reformers
have leveled their artillery against the toilet, from the
time of St. Jerome downward; and Tom Moore has put into
beautiful and graceful verse St. Jerome&rsquo;s admonitions to the
fair churchgoers of his time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the defect of all these modes of warfare on the elegances
and refinements of the toilet was that they were too
indiscriminate. They were in reality founded on a false
principle. They took for granted that there was something
radically corrupt and wicked in the body and in the physical
system. According to this mode of viewing things, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
body was a loathsome and pestilent prison, in which the
soul was locked up and enslaved, and the eyes, the ears,
the taste, the smell, were all so many corrupt traitors in
conspiracy to poison her. Physical beauty of every sort
was a snare, a Circean enchantment, to be valiantly contended
with and straitly eschewed. Hence they preached,
not moderation, but total abstinence from all pursuit of
physical grace and beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, a resistance founded on an over-statement is constantly
tending to reaction. People always have a tendency
to begin thinking for themselves; and when they so
think, they perceive that a good and wise God would not
have framed our bodies with such exquisite care only to
corrupt our souls,&mdash;that physical beauty, being created in
such profuse abundance around us, and we being possessed
with such a longing for it, must have its uses, its legitimate
sphere of exercise. Even the poor, shrouded nun, as she
walks the convent garden, cannot help asking herself why, if
the crimson velvet of the rose was made by God, all colors
except black and white are sinful for her; and the modest
Quaker, after hanging all her house and dressing all her
children in drab, cannot but marvel at the sudden outstreaking
of blue and yellow and crimson in the tulip-beds under
her window, and reflect how very differently the great All-Father
arrays the world&rsquo;s housekeeping. The consequence
of all this has been, that the reforms based upon these severe
and exclusive views have gradually gone backward.
The Quaker dress is imperceptibly and gracefully melting
away into a refined simplicity of modern costume, which in
many cases seems to be the perfection of taste. The obvious
reflection, that one color of the rainbow is quite as
much of God as another, has led the children of gentle
dove-colored mothers to appear in shades of rose-color, blue,
and lilac; and wise elders have said, it is not so much the
color or the shape that we object to, as giving too much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
time and too much money,&mdash;if the heart be right with God
and man, the bonnet ribbon may be of any shade you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Pheasant, &ldquo;that a certain
fixed dress, marking the unworldly character of a religious
order, is desirable? Now, I have said before that I am
very fond of dress. I have a passion for beauty and completeness
in it; and as long as I am in the world and obliged
to dress as the world does, it constantly haunts me, and
tempts me to give more time, more thought, more money, to
these things than I really think they are worth. But I can
conceive of giving up this thing altogether as being much
easier than regulating it to the precise point. I never read
of a nun&rsquo;s taking the veil without a certain thrill of sympathy.
To cut off one&rsquo;s hair, to take off and cast from her,
one by one, all one&rsquo;s trinkets and jewels, to lie down and
have the pall thrown over one, and feel one&rsquo;s self once for
all dead to the world,&mdash;I cannot help feeling as if this were
real, thorough, noble renunciation, and as if one might rise
up from it with a grand, calm consciousness of having risen
to a higher and purer atmosphere, and got above all the
littlenesses and distractions that beset us here. So I have
heard charming young Quaker girls, who in more thoughtless
days indulged in what for them was a slight shading of
worldly conformity, say that it was to them a blessed rest
when they put on the strict, plain dress, and felt that they
really had taken up the cross and turned their backs on
the world. I can conceive of doing this, much more easily
than I can of striking the exact line between worldly conformity
and noble aspiration, in the life I live now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we all overlook one great
leading principle of our nature, and that is, that we are
made to find a higher pleasure in self-sacrifice than in any
form of self-indulgence. There is something grand and
pathetic in the idea of an entire self-surrender, to which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
every human soul leaps up, as we do to the sound of martial
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many boys of Boston and New York, who had
lived effeminate and idle lives, felt this new power uprising
in them in our war! How they embraced the dirt and
discomfort and fatigue and watchings and toils of camp-life
with an eagerness of zest which they had never felt in the
pursuit of mere pleasure, and wrote home burning letters
that they never were so happy in their lives! It was not
that dirt and fatigue and discomfort and watchings and
weariness were in themselves agreeable, but it was a joy to
feel themselves able to bear all and surrender all for something
higher than self. Many a poor Battery bully of New
York, many a street rowdy, felt uplifted by the discovery that
he too had hid away under the dirt and dust of his former
life this divine and precious jewel. He leaped for joy to
find that he too could be a hero. Think of the hundreds of
thousands of plain ordinary workingmen, and of seemingly
ordinary boys, who, but for such a crisis, might have passed
through life never knowing this to be in them, and who
courageously endured hunger and thirst and cold, and separation
from dearest friends, for days and weeks and months,
when they might, at any day, have bought a respite by
deserting their country&rsquo;s flag! Starving boys, sick at heart,
dizzy in head, pining for home and mother, still found
warmth and comfort in the one thought that they could
suffer, die, for their country; and the graves at Salisbury
and Andersonville show in how many souls this noble power
of self-sacrifice to the higher good was lodged,&mdash;how many
there were, even in the humblest walks of life, who preferred
death by torture to life in dishonor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this heroic element in man and woman that makes
self-sacrifice an ennobling and purifying ordeal in any religious
profession. The man really is taken into a higher
region of his own nature, and finds a pleasure in the exercise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
of higher faculties which he did not suppose himself to
possess. Whatever sacrifice is supposed to be duty, whether
the supposition be really correct or not, has in it an ennobling
and purifying power; and thus the eras of conversion
from one form of the Christian religion to another are often
marked with a real and permanent exaltation of the whole
character. But it does not follow that certain religious
beliefs and ordinances are in themselves just, because they
thus touch the great heroic master-chord of the human soul.
To wear sackcloth and sleep on a plank may have been of
use to many souls, as symbolizing the awakening of this
higher nature; but, still, the religion of the New Testament
is plainly one which calls to no such outward and evident
sacrifices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was John the Baptist, and not the Messiah, who
dwelt in the wilderness and wore garments of camel&rsquo;s hair;
and Jesus was commented on, not for his asceticism, but for
his cheerful, social acceptance of the average innocent wants
and enjoyments of humanity. &lsquo;The Son of man came eating
and drinking.&rsquo; The great, and never ceasing, and utter
self-sacrifice of his life was not signified by any peculiarity
of costume, or language, or manner; it showed itself only
as it unconsciously welled up in all his words and actions,
in his estimates of life, in all that marked him out as a being
of a higher and holier sphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not believe in influencing this subject of
dress by religious persons&rsquo; adopting any particular laws of
costume?&rdquo; said Pheasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see it to be possible,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;considering how
society is made up. There are such differences of taste and
character,&mdash;people move in such different spheres, are
influenced by such different circumstances,&mdash;that all we
can do is to lay down certain great principles, and leave
it to every one to apply them according to individual
needs.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But what are these principles? There is the grand
inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us feel our way. In the first
place, then, we are all agreed in one starting-point,&mdash;that
beauty is not to be considered as a bad thing,&mdash;that the
love of ornament in our outward and physical life is not a
sinful or a dangerous feeling, and only leads to evil, as all
other innocent things do, by being used in wrong ways.
So far we are all agreed, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said all the voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, therefore, neither wicked nor silly nor weak-minded
to like beautiful dress, and all that goes to make
it up. Jewelry, diamonds, pearls, emeralds, rubies, and all
sorts of pretty things that are made of them, are as lawful
and innocent objects of admiration and desire, as flowers or
birds or butterflies, or the tints of evening skies. Gems,
in fact, are a species of mineral flower; they are the blossoms
of the dark, hard mine; and what they want in perfume
they make up in durability. The best Christian in
the world may, without the least inconsistency, admire
them, and say, as a charming, benevolent old Quaker lady
once said to me, &lsquo;I do so love to look at beautiful jewelry!&rsquo;
The love of beautiful dress, in itself, therefore, so far from
being in a bad sense worldly, may be the same indication
of a refined and poetical nature that is given by the love
of flowers and of natural objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the third place, there is nothing in itself wrong, or
unworthy a rational being, in a certain degree of attention
to the fashion of society in our costume. It is not wrong to
be annoyed at unnecessary departures from the commonly
received practices of good society in the matter of the arrangement
of our toilet; and it would indicate rather an
unamiable want of sympathy with our fellow beings, if we
were not willing, for the most part, to follow what they indicate
to be agreeable in the disposition of our outward affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say, Mr. Crowfield, you are allowing us
all a very generous margin,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am coming to the restrictions.
When is love of dress excessive and wrong? To this I
answer by stating my faith in one of old Plato&rsquo;s ideas, in
which he speaks of beauty and its uses. He says there
were two impersonations of beauty worshiped under the
name of Venus in the ancient times,&mdash;the one celestial,
born of the highest gods, the other earthly. To the earthly
Venus the sacrifices were such as were more trivial; to the
celestial, such as were more holy. &lsquo;The worship of the
earthly Venus,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;sends us oftentimes on unworthy
and trivial errands, but the worship of the celestial to high
and honorable friendships, to noble aspirations and heroic
actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it seems to me that, if we bear in mind this truth
in regard to beauty, we shall have a test with which to try
ourselves in the matter of physical adornment. We are
always excessive when we sacrifice the higher beauty to
attain the lower one. A woman who will sacrifice domestic
affection, conscience, self-respect, honor, to love of dress, we
all agree, loves dress too much. She loses the true and
higher beauty of womanhood for the lower beauty of gems
and flowers and colors. A girl who sacrifices to dress all
her time, all her strength, all her money, to the neglect of
the cultivation of her mind and heart, and to the neglect
of the claims of others on her helpfulness, is sacrificing the
higher to the lower beauty; her fault is not the love of
beauty, but loving the wrong and inferior kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is remarkable that the directions of Holy Writ, in
regard to the female dress, should distinctly take note of
this difference between the higher and the lower beauty
which we find in the works of Plato. The Apostle gives
no rule, no specific costume, which should mark the Christian
woman from the Pagan; but says, &lsquo;whose adorning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair,
and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let
it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
which is in the sight of God of great price.&rsquo; The gold and
gems and apparel are not forbidden; but we are told not
to depend on them for beauty, to the neglect of those imperishable,
immortal graces that belong to the soul. The
makers of fashion among whom Christian women lived
when the Apostle wrote were the same class of brilliant and
worthless Aspasias who make the fashions of modern Paris;
and all womankind was sunk into slavish adoration of more
physical adornment when the gospel sent forth among them
this call to the culture of a higher and immortal beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fine, girls,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you may try yourselves by
this standard. You love dress too much when you care
more for your outward adornings than for your inward dispositions,
when it afflicts you more to have torn your
dress than to have lost your temper, when you are more
troubled by an ill-fitting gown than by a neglected duty,&mdash;when
you are less concerned at having made an unjust comment,
or spread a scandalous report, than at having worn
a passé bonnet, when you are less troubled at the thought
of being found at the last great feast without the wedding
garment, than at being found at the party to-night in the
fashion of last year. No Christian woman, as I view it,
ought to give such attention to her dress as to allow it to
take up <i>all</i> of three very important things, viz:&mdash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span><i>All</i> her time.<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span><i>All</i> her strength.<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span><i>All</i> her money.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Whoever does this lives not the Christian, but the Pagan
life,&mdash;worships not at the Christian&rsquo;s altar of our Lord
Jesus, but at the shrine of the lower Venus of Corinth and
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh now, Mr. Crowfield, you frighten me,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so afraid, do you know, that I am doing
exactly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; said Pheasant; &ldquo;and yet, certainly, it is
not what I mean or intend to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how to help it,&rdquo; said Dove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;where there is a will there is a
way. Only resolve that you will put the true beauty first,&mdash;that,
even if you do have to seem unfashionable, you
will follow the highest beauty of womanhood,&mdash;and the
battle is half gained. Only resolve that your time, your
strength, your money, such as you have, shall not all&mdash;nor
more than half&mdash;be given to mere outward adornment,
and you will go right. It requires only an army of girls
animated with this noble purpose to declare independence in
America, and emancipate us from the decrees and tyrannies
of French actresses and ballet-dancers. <i>En avant</i>, girls!
You yet can, if you will, save the republic.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>X <br /><br />WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF BEAUTY IN DRESS</h3>
</div>
<p>The conversation on dress which I had held with Jenny
and her little covey of Birds of Paradise appeared to have
worked in the minds of the fair council, for it was not long
before they invaded my study again in a body. They were
going out to a party, but called for Jenny, and of course
gave me and Mrs. Crowfield the privilege of seeing them
equipped for conquest.</p>
<p>Latterly, I must confess, the mysteries of the toilet rites
have impressed me with a kind of superstitious awe.
Only a year ago my daughter Jenny had smooth dark hair,
which she wreathed in various soft, flowing lines about
her face, and confined in a classical knot on the back of
her head. Jenny had rather a talent for coiffure, and the
arrangement of her hair was one of my little artistic delights.
She always had something there,&mdash;a leaf, a spray, a bud or
blossom, that looked fresh, and had a sort of poetical grace
of its own.</p>
<p>But in a gradual way all this has been changing.
Jenny&rsquo;s hair first became slightly wavy, then curly, finally
frizzly, presenting a tumbled and twisted appearance, which
gave me great inward concern; but when I spoke upon the
subject I was always laughingly silenced with the definitive
settling remark: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the fashion, papa! Everybody
wears it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I particularly objected to the change on my own small
account, because the smooth, breakfast-table coiffure, which
I had always so much enjoyed, was now often exchanged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
for a peculiarly bristling appearance; the hair being variously
twisted, tortured, woven, and wound, without the
least view to immediate beauty or grace. But all this, I
was informed, was the necessary means towards crimping for
some evening display of a more elaborate nature than usual.</p>
<p>Mrs. Crowfield and myself are not party-goers by profession,
but Jenny insists on our going out at least once or
twice in a season, just, as she says, to keep up with the
progress of society; and at these times I have been struck
with frequent surprise by the general untidiness which appeared
to have come over the heads of all my female friends.
I know, of course, that I am only a poor, ignorant, bewildered
man creature; but to my uninitiated eyes they looked
as if they had all, after a very restless and perturbed sleep,
come out of bed without smoothing their tumbled and disordered
locks. Then, every young lady, without exception,
seemed to have one kind of hair, and that the kind which
was rather suggestive of the term &ldquo;woolly.&rdquo; Every sort of
wild abandon of frowzy locks seemed to be in vogue; in
some cases the hair appearing to my vision nothing but a
confused snarl, in which glittered tinklers, spangles, and
bits of tinsel, and from which waved long pennants and
streamers of different colored ribbons.</p>
<p>I was in fact very greatly embarrassed by my first meeting
with some very charming girls, whom I thought I knew
as familiarly as my own daughter Jenny, and whose soft,
pretty hair had often formed the object of my admiration.
Now, however, they revealed themselves to me in coiffures
which forcibly reminded me of the electrical experiments
which used to entertain us in college, when the subject
stood on the insulated stool, and each particular hair of his
head bristled and rose, and set up, as it were, on its own
account. This high-flying condition of the tresses, and the
singularity of the ornaments which appeared to be thrown
at haphazard into them, suggested so oddly the idea of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
bewitched person, that I could scarcely converse with any
presence of mind, or realize that these really were the nice,
well-informed, sensible little girls of my own neighborhood,&mdash;the
good daughters, good sisters, Sunday-school teachers,
and other familiar members of our best educated circles;
and I came away from the party in a sort of blue maze, and
hardly in a state to conduct myself with credit in the examination
through which I knew Jenny would put me as to
the appearance of her different friends.</p>
<p>I know not how it is, but the glamour of fashion in the
eyes of girlhood is so complete that the oddest, wildest,
most uncouth devices find grace and favor in the eyes of
even well-bred girls, when once that invisible, ineffable
aura has breathed over them which declares them to be
fashionable. They may defy them for a time,&mdash;they may
pronounce them horrid; but it is with a secretly melting
heart, and with a mental reservation to look as nearly like
the abhorred spectacle as they possibly can on the first
favorable opportunity.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the visit referred to, Jenny ushered
her three friends in triumph into my study; and, in truth,
the little room seemed to be perfectly transformed by their
brightness. My honest, nice, lovable little Yankee fireside
girls were, to be sure, got up in a style that would have
done credit to Madame Pompadour, or any of the most
questionable characters of the time of Louis XIV. or XV.
They were frizzled and powdered, and built up in elaborate
devices; they wore on their hair flowers, gems, streamers,
tinklers, humming-birds, butterflies, South American beetles,
beads, bugles, and all imaginable rattletraps, which jingled
and clinked with every motion; and yet, as they were
three or four fresh, handsome, intelligent, bright-eyed girls,
there was no denying the fact that they did look extremely
pretty; and as they sailed hither and thither before me,
and gazed down upon me in the saucy might of their rosy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
girlhood, there was a gay defiance in Jenny&rsquo;s demand,
&ldquo;Now, papa, how do you like us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very charming,&rdquo; answered I, surrendering at discretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, girls, that you could convert him to the
fashions, if he should once see you in party trim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, my dear; I am not converted to the
fashion, but to you, and that is a point on which I didn&rsquo;t
need conversion; but the present fashions, even so fairly
represented as I see them, I humbly confess I dislike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Crowfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dears, I do. But then, I protest, I&rsquo;m not
fairly treated. I think, for a young American girl, who
looks as most of my fair friends do look, to come down
with her bright eyes and all her little panoply of graces
upon an old fellow like me, and expect him to like a
fashion merely because <i>she</i> looks well in it, is all sheer
nonsense. Why, girls, if you wore rings in your noses,
and bangles on your arms up to your elbows, if you tied
your hair in a war-knot on the top of your heads like the
Sioux Indians, you would still look pretty. The question
isn&rsquo;t, as I view it, whether you look pretty,&mdash;for that you
do, and that you will, do what you please and dress how
you will. The question is whether you might not look
prettier, whether another style of dress, and another mode
of getting up, would not be far more becoming. I am one
who thinks that it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Crowfield, you positively are too bad,&rdquo; said
Humming-Bird, whose delicate head was encircled by a sort
of crêpy cloud of bright hair, sparkling with gold-dust and
spangles, in the midst of which, just over her forehead, a
gorgeous blue butterfly was perched, while a confused mixture
of hairs, gold-powder, spangles, stars, and tinkling
ornaments fell in a sort of cataract down her pretty neck.
&ldquo;You see, we girls think everything of you; and now we
don&rsquo;t like it that you don&rsquo;t like our fashions.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my little princess, so long as I like <i>you</i> better
than your fashions, and merely think they are not worthy
of you, what&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, to be sure. You sweeten the dose to us babies
with that sugarplum. But really, Mr. Crowfield, why don&rsquo;t
you like the fashions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, to my view, they are in great part in false taste,
and injure the beauty of the girls,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;They are
inappropriate to their characters, and make them look like
a kind and class of women whom they do not, and I trust
never will, resemble internally, and whose mark therefore
they ought not to bear externally. But there you are, beguiling
me into a sermon which you will only hate me in
your hearts for preaching. Go along, children! You certainly
look as well as anybody can in that style of getting
up; so go to your party, and to-morrow night, when you are
tired and sleepy, if you&rsquo;ll come with your crochet, and sit
in my study, I will read you Christopher Crowfield&rsquo;s dissertation
on dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be amusing, to say the least,&rdquo; said Humming-Bird;
&ldquo;and, be sure, we will all be here. And mind, you
have to show good reasons for disliking the present fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next evening there was a worsted party in my
study, sitting in the midst of which I read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF BEAUTY IN DRESS</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The first one is <i>appropriateness</i>. Colors and forms and
modes, in themselves graceful or beautiful, can become ungraceful
and ridiculous simply through inappropriateness.
The most lovely bonnet that the most approved modiste can
invent, if worn on the head of a coarse-faced Irishwoman
bearing a market-basket on her arm, excites no emotion but
that of the ludicrous. The most elegant and brilliant evening
dress, if worn in the daytime in a railroad car, strikes
every one with a sense of absurdity; whereas both these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
objects in appropriate associations would excite only the idea
of beauty. So a mode of dress obviously intended for driving
strikes us as <i>outré</i> in a parlor; and a parlor dress would
no less shock our eyes on horseback. In short, the course
of this principle through all varieties of form can easily be
perceived. Besides appropriateness to time, place, and circumstances,
there is appropriateness to age, position, and
character. This is the foundation of all our ideas of professional
propriety in costume. One would not like to see a
clergyman in his external air and appointments resembling
a gentleman of the turf; one would not wish a refined and
modest scholar to wear the outward air of a fast fellow, or
an aged and venerable statesman to appear with all the
peculiarities of a young dandy. The flowers, feathers, and
furbelows which a light-hearted young girl of seventeen
embellishes by the airy grace with which she wears them,
are simply ridiculous when transferred to the toilet of her
serious, well-meaning mamma, who bears them about with
an anxious face, merely because a loquacious milliner has
assured her, with many protestations, that it is the fashion,
and the only thing remaining for her to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, again, modes of dress in themselves very
beautiful and very striking, which are peculiarly adapted to
theatrical representation and to pictures, but the adoption
of which as a part of unprofessional toilet produces a sense
of incongruity. A mode of dress maybe in perfect taste on
the stage, that would be absurd in an evening party, absurd
in the street, absurd, in short, everywhere else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you come to my first objection to our present American
toilet,&mdash;its being to a very great extent <i>inappropriate</i>
to our climate, to our habits of life and thought, and to the
whole structure of ideas on which our life is built. What
we want, apparently, is some court of inquiry and adaptation
that shall pass judgment on the fashions of other countries,
and modify them to make them a graceful expression of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
own national character, and modes of thinking and living.
A certain class of women in Paris at this present hour makes
the fashions that rule the feminine world. They are women
who live only for the senses, with as utter and obvious disregard
of any moral or intellectual purpose to be answered
in living as a paroquet or a macaw. They have no family
ties; love, in its pure domestic sense, is an impossibility in
their lot; religion in any sense is another impossibility; and
their whole intensity of existence, therefore, is concentrated
on the question of sensuous enjoyment, and that personal
adornment which is necessary to secure it. When the great
ruling country in the world of taste and fashion has fallen
into such a state that the virtual leaders of fashion are women
of this character, it is not to be supposed that the fashions
emanating from them will be of a kind well adapted to
express the ideas, the thoughts, the state of society, of a great
Christian democracy such as ours ought to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is called, for example, the Pompadour style of
dress, so much in vogue of late, we can see to be perfectly
adapted to the kind of existence led by dissipated women
whose life is one revel of excitement; and who, never proposing
to themselves any intellectual employment or any
domestic duty, can afford to spend three or four hours every
day under the hands of a waiting-maid, in alternately tangling
and untangling their hair. Powder, paint, gold-dust
and silver-dust, pomatums, cosmetics, are all perfectly appropriate
where the ideal of life is to keep up a false show of
beauty after the true bloom is wasted by dissipation. The
woman who never goes to bed till morning, who never even
dresses herself, who never takes a needle in her hand, who
never goes to church, and never entertains one serious idea
of duty of any kind, when got up in Pompadour style, has,
to say the truth, the good taste and merit of appropriateness.
Her dress expresses just what she is,&mdash;all false, all
artificial, all meretricious and unnatural; no part or portion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
of her from which it might be inferred what her Creator
originally designed her to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when a nice little American girl, who has been
brought up to cultivate her mind, to refine her taste, to care
for her health, to be a helpful daughter and a good sister, to
visit the poor and teach in Sunday schools; when a good,
sweet, modest little puss of this kind combs all her pretty
hair backward till it is one mass of frowsy confusion; when
she powders, and paints under her eyes; when she adopts,
with eager enthusiasm, every <i>outré</i>, unnatural fashion that
comes from the most dissipated foreign circles,&mdash;she is in
bad taste, because she does not represent either her character,
her education, or her good points. She looks like a
second-rate actress, when she is, in fact, a most thoroughly
respectable, estimable, lovable little girl, and on the way, as
we poor fellows fondly hope, to bless some one of us with
her tenderness and care in some nice home in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the fashion in America for young girls to have
waiting-maids,&mdash;in foreign countries it is the fashion. All
this meretricious toilet&mdash;so elaborate, so complicated, and so
contrary to nature&mdash;must be accomplished, and it is accomplished,
by the busy little fingers of each girl for herself;
and so it seems to be very evident that a style of hair-dressing
which it will require hours to disentangle, which must
injure and in time ruin the natural beauty of the hair, ought
to be one thing which a well-regulated court of inquiry would
reject in our American fashions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the genius of American life is for simplicity and
absence of ostentation. We have no parade of office: our public
men wear no robes, no stars, garters, collars, etc.; and it
would, therefore, be in good taste in our women to cultivate
simple styles of dress. Now I object to the present fashions,
as adopted from France, that they are flashy and theatrical.
Having their origin with a community whose senses are
blunted, drugged, and deadened with dissipation and ostentation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
they reject the simpler forms of beauty, and seek for
startling effects, for odd and unexpected results. The contemplation
of one of our fashionable churches, at the hour
when its fair occupants pour forth, gives one a great deal of
surprise. The toilets there displayed might have been in
good keeping among showy Parisian women in an opera
house, but even their original inventors would have been
shocked at the idea of carrying them into a church. The
rawness of our American mind as to the subject of propriety
in dress is nowhere more shown than in the fact that no apparent
distinction is made between church and opera house
in the adaptation of attire. Very estimable and we trust
very religious young women sometimes enter the house of
God in a costume which makes their utterance of the words
of the litany and the acts of prostrate devotion in the service
seem almost burlesque. When a brisk little creature comes
into a pew with hair frizzed till it stands on end in a most
startling manner, rattling strings of beads and bits of tinsel,
mounting over all some pert little hat with a red or green
feather standing saucily upright in front, she may look exceedingly
pretty and piquant; and, if she came there for
a game of croquet or a tableau party, would be all in very
good taste; but as she comes to confess that she is a miserable
sinner, that she has done the things she ought not to
have done, and left undone the things she ought to have
done,&mdash;as she takes upon her lips most solemn and tremendous
words, whose meaning runs far beyond life into a
sublime eternity,&mdash;there is a discrepancy which would be
ludicrous if it were not melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is apt to think, at first view, that St. Jerome was
right in saying,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&lsquo;She who comes in glittering vest<br />
To mourn her frailty, still is frail.&rsquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But St. Jerome was in the wrong, after all; for a flashy,
unsuitable attire in church is not always a mark of an undevout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
or entirely worldly mind; it is simply a mark of a
raw, uncultivated taste. In Italy, the ecclesiastical law prescribing
a uniform black dress for the churches gives a sort
of education to European ideas of propriety in toilet, which
prevents churches from being made theatres for the same
kind of display which is held to be in good taste at places
of public amusement. It is but justice to the inventors of
Parisian fashions to say that, had they ever had the smallest
idea of going to church and Sunday school, as our good girls
do, they would immediately have devised toilets appropriate
to such exigencies. If it were any part of their plan of
life to appear statedly in public to confess themselves &lsquo;miserable
sinners,&rsquo; we should doubtless have sent over here
the design of some graceful penitential habit, which would
give our places of worship a much more appropriate air than
they now have. As it is, it would form a subject for such
a court of inquiry and adaptation as we have supposed, to
draw a line between the costume of the theatre and the
church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same manner, there is a want of appropriateness
in the costume of our American women, who display in the
street promenade a style of dress and adornment originally
intended for showy carriage drives in such great exhibition
grounds as the Bois de Boulogne. The makers of Parisian
fashions are not generally walkers. They do not, with all
their extravagance, have the bad taste to trail yards of silk
and velvet over the mud and dirt of a pavement, or promenade
the street in a costume so pronounced and striking as
to draw the involuntary glance of every eye; and the showy
toilets displayed on the <i>pavé</i> by American young women
have more than once exposed them to misconstruction in
the eyes of foreign observers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to appropriateness, the second requisite to beauty
in dress I take to be unity of effect. In speaking of the
arrangement of rooms in the &lsquo;House and Home Papers,&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
I criticised some apartments wherein were many showy
articles of furniture, and much expense had been incurred,
because, with all this, there was no <i>unity of result</i>. The
carpet was costly, and in itself handsome; the paper was
also in itself handsome and costly; the tables and chairs
also in themselves very elegant; and yet, owing to a want
of any unity of idea, any grand harmonizing tint of color,
or method of arrangement, the rooms had a jumbled, confused
air, and nothing about them seemed particularly
pretty or effective. I instanced rooms where thousands of
dollars had been spent, which, because of this defect, never
excited admiration; and others in which the furniture was
of the cheapest description, but which always gave immediate
and universal pleasure. The same rule holds good in
dress. As in every apartment, so in every toilet, there
should be one ground-tone or dominant color, which should
rule all the others, and there should be a general style of
idea to which everything should be subjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may illustrate the effect of this principle in a very
familiar case. It is generally conceded that the majority
of women look better in mourning than they do in their
ordinary apparel; a comparatively plain person looks almost
handsome in simple black. Now why is this? Simply
because mourning requires a severe uniformity of color and
idea, and forbids the display of that variety of colors and
objects which go to make up the ordinary female costume,
and which very few women have such skill in using as to
produce really beautiful effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very similar results have been attained by the Quaker
costume, which, in spite of the quaint severity of the forms
to which it adhered, has always had a remarkable degree of
becomingness, because of its restriction to a few simple colors
and to the absence of distracting ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the same effect which is produced in mourning or
the Quaker costume may be preserved in a style of dress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
admitting color and ornamentation. A dress may have the
richest fullness of color, and still the tints may be so chastened
and subdued as to produce the impression of a severe
simplicity. Suppose, for example, a golden-haired blonde
chooses for the ground-tone of her toilet a deep shade of
purple, such as affords a good background for the hair and
complexion. The larger draperies of the costume being of
this color, the bonnet may be of a lighter shade of the same,
ornamented with lilac hyacinths, shading insensibly towards
rose-color. The effect of such a costume is simple, even
though there be much ornament, because it is ornament
artistically disposed towards a general result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dark shade of green being chosen as the ground-tone
of a dress, the whole costume may, in like manner, be
worked up through lighter and brighter shades of green, in
which rose-colored flowers may appear with the same impression
of simple appropriateness that is made by the pink
blossom over the green leaves of a rose. There have been
times in France when the study of color produced artistic
effects in costume worthy of attention, and resulted in styles
of dress of real beauty. But the present corrupted state of
morals there has introduced a corrupt taste in dress; and it
is worthy of thought that the decline of moral purity in
society is often marked by the deterioration of the sense of
artistic beauty. Corrupt and dissipated social epochs produce
corrupt styles of architecture and corrupt styles of
drawing and painting, as might easily be illustrated by the
history of art. When the leaders of society have blunted
their finer perceptions by dissipation and immorality, they
are incapable of feeling the beauties which come from delicate
concords and truly artistic combinations. They verge
towards barbarism, and require things that are strange, odd,
dazzling, and peculiar to captivate their jaded senses. Such
we take to be the condition of Parisian society now. The
tone of it is given by women who are essentially impudent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
and vulgar, who override and overrule, by the mere brute
force of opulence and luxury, women of finer natures and
moral tone. The court of France is a court of adventurers,
of parvenus; and the palaces, the toilets, the equipage, the
entertainments, of the mistresses outshine those of the lawful
wives. Hence comes a style of dress which is in itself
vulgar, ostentatious, pretentious, without simplicity, without
unity, seeking to dazzle by strange combinations and daring
contrasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when the fashions emanating from such a state
of society come to our country, where it has been too much
the habit to put on and wear, without dispute and without
inquiry, any or every thing that France sends, the results
produced are often things to make one wonder. A respectable
man, sitting quietly in church or other public assembly,
may be pardoned sometimes for indulging a silent sense of
the ridiculous in the contemplation of the forest of bonnets
which surround him, as he humbly asks himself the question,
Were these meant to cover the head, to defend it, or
to ornament it? and, if they are intended for any of these
purposes, how?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, to me nothing is so surprising as the sort of
things which well-bred women serenely wear on their heads
with the idea that they are ornaments. On my right hand
sits a good-looking girl with a thing on her head which
seems to consist mostly of bunches of grass, straws, with a
confusion of lace, in which sits a draggled bird, looking as
if the cat had had him before the lady. In front of her
sits another, who has a glittering confusion of beads swinging
hither and thither from a jaunty little structure of black
and red velvet. An anxious-looking matron appears under
the high eaves of a bonnet with a gigantic crimson rose
crushed down into a mass of tangled hair. She is <i>ornamented</i>!
she has no doubt about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, that a style of dress which allows the use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
of everything in heaven above or earth beneath requires
more taste and skill in disposition than falls to the lot of
most of the female sex to make it even tolerable. In consequence,
the flowers, fruits, grass, hay, straw, oats, butterflies,
beads, birds, tinsel, streamers, jinglers, lace, bugles,
crape, which seem to be appointed to form a covering for
the female head, very often appear in combinations so singular,
and the results, taken in connection with all the rest
of the costume, are such, that we really think the people
who usually assemble in a Quaker meeting-house are, with
their entire absence of ornament, more becomingly attired
than the majority of our public audiences. For if one considers
his own impression after having seen an assemblage
of women dressed in Quaker costume, he will find it to be,
not of a confusion of twinkling finery, but of many fair,
sweet faces, of charming, nice-looking women, and not of
articles of dress. Now this shows that the severe dress,
after all, has better answered the true purpose of dress, in
setting forth the <i>woman</i>, than our modern costume, where
the woman is but one item in a flying mass of colors and
forms, all of which distract attention from the faces they are
supposed to adorn. The dress of the Philadelphian ladies
has always been celebrated for its elegance of effect, from the
fact, probably, that the early Quaker parentage of the city
formed the eye and the taste of its women for uniform and
simple styles of color, and for purity and chastity of lines.
The most perfect toilets that have ever been achieved in
America have probably been those of the class familiarly
called the gay Quakers,&mdash;children of Quaker families, who,
while abandoning the strict rules of the sect, yet retain their
modest and severe reticence, relying on richness of material,
and soft, harmonious coloring, rather than striking and dazzling
ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next source of beauty in dress is the impression of
truthfulness and reality. It is a well-known principle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
the fine arts, in all their branches, that all shams and
mere pretenses are to be rejected,&mdash;a truth which Ruskin
has shown with the full lustre of his many-colored prose-poetry.
As stucco pretending to be marble, and graining
pretending to be wood, are in false taste in building, so
false jewelry and cheap fineries of every kind are in bad
taste; so also is powder instead of natural complexion,
false hair instead of real, and flesh-painting of every description.
I have even the hardihood to think and assert,
in the presence of a generation whereof not one woman in
twenty wears her own hair, that the simple, short-cropped
locks of Rosa Bonheur are in a more beautiful style of hair-dressing
than the most elaborate edifice of curls, rats, and
waterfalls that is erected on any fair head nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Crowfield! you hit us all now,&rdquo; cried several
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, girls,&mdash;I know it. I admit that you are
all looking very pretty; but I do maintain that you are
none of you doing yourselves justice, and that Nature, if
you would only follow her, would do better for you than
all these elaborations. A short crop of your own hair, that
you could brush out in ten minutes every morning, would
have a more real, healthy beauty than the elaborate structures
which cost you hours of time, and give you the headache
besides. I speak of the short crop,&mdash;to put the case
at the very lowest figure,&mdash;for many of you have lovely
hair of different lengths, and susceptible of a variety of
arrangements, if you did not suppose yourself obliged to
build after a foreign pattern, instead of following out the
intentions of the great Artist who made you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary absolutely that every woman and girl
should look exactly like every other one? There are women
whom Nature makes with wavy or curly hair: let
them follow her. There are those whom she makes with
soft and smooth locks, and with whom crinkling and crêping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
is only a sham. They look very pretty with it, to be
sure; but, after all, is there but one style of beauty?
and might they not look prettier in cultivating the style
which Nature seemed to have intended for them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the floods of false jewelry, glass beads, and tinsel
finery which seem to be sweeping over the toilet of our
women, I must protest that they are vulgarizing the taste,
and having a seriously bad effect on the delicacy of artistic
perception. It is almost impossible to manage such material
and give any kind of idea of neatness or purity; for the
least wear takes away their newness. And, of all disreputable
things, tumbled, rumpled, and tousled finery is the most
disreputable. A simple white muslin, that can come fresh
from the laundry every week, is, in point of real taste,
worth any amount of spangled tissues. A plain straw bonnet,
with only a ribbon across it, is in reality in better taste
than rubbishy birds or butterflies, or tinsel ornaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, girls, don&rsquo;t dress at haphazard; for dress, so
far from being a matter of small consequence, is in reality
one of the fine arts,&mdash;so far from trivial, that each country
ought to have a style of its own, and each individual such a
liberty of modification of the general fashion as suits and
befits her person, her age, her position in life, and the kind
of character she wishes to maintain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only motive in toilet which seems to have obtained
much as yet among young girls is the very vague impulse
to look &lsquo;stylish,&rsquo;&mdash;a desire which must answer for more
vulgar dressing than one would wish to see. If girls would
rise above this, and desire to express by their dress the attributes
of true ladyhood, nicety of eye, fastidious neatness,
purity of taste, truthfulness, and sincerity of nature, they
might form, each one for herself, a style having its own individual
beauty, incapable of ever becoming common and
vulgar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truly trained taste and eye would enable a lady to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
select from the permitted forms of fashion such as might be
modified to her purposes, always remembering that simplicity
is safe, that to attempt little and succeed is better than
to attempt a great deal and fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, girls, I will finish by reciting to you the
lines old Ben Jonson addressed to the pretty girls of his
time, which form an appropriate ending to my remarks:&mdash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent10'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Still to be dressed<br />
As you were going to a feast;<br />
Still to be powdered, still perfumed;<br />

All is not sweet, all is not sound.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Give me a look, give me a face,<br />

<h3>XI <br /><br />THE CATHEDRAL</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to build a cathedral one of these days,&rdquo; said
I to my wife, as I sat looking at the slant line of light made
by the afternoon sun on our picture of the Cathedral of
Milan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That picture is one of the most poetic things you have
among your house ornaments,&rdquo; said Rudolph. &ldquo;Its original
is the world&rsquo;s chief beauty,&mdash;a tribute to religion
such as Art never gave before and never can again,&mdash;as
much before the Pantheon as the Alps, with their virgin
snows and glittering pinnacles, are above all temples made
with hands. Say what you will, those Middle Ages that
you call Dark had a glory of faith that never will be seen
in our days of cotton-mills and Manchester prints. Where
will you marshal such an army of saints as stands in yonder
white-marble forest, visibly transfigured and glorified in that
celestial Italian air? Saintship belonged to the medieval
Church; the heroism of religion has died with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like one of your assertions, Rudolph,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;You might as well say that Nature has never made
any flowers since Linn&aelig;us shut up his herbarium. We
have no statues and pictures of modern saints; but saints
themselves, thank God, have never been wanting. &lsquo;As it
was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about your cathedral?&rdquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&mdash;my cathedral,&mdash;yes. When my stocks in
cloud-land rise, I&rsquo;ll build a cathedral larger than Milan&rsquo;s; and
the men, but more particularly the women, thereon, shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
be those who have done even more than Saint Paul tells
of in the saints of old, who &lsquo;subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the
edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.&rsquo;
I am not now thinking of Florence Nightingale, nor of the
host of women who have been walking worthily in her footsteps,
but of nameless saints of more retired and private
state,&mdash;domestic saints, who have tended children not their
own through whooping-cough and measles, and borne the
unruly whims of fretful invalids,&mdash;stocking-darning, shirt-making
saints,&mdash;saints who wore no visible garment of
haircloth, bound themselves with no belts of spikes and
nails, yet in their inmost souls were marked and seared with
the red cross of a lifelong self-sacrifice,&mdash;saints for whom
the mystical terms self-annihilation and self-crucifixion had
a real and tangible meaning, all the stronger because their
daily death was marked by no outward sign. No mystical
rites consecrated them; no organ-music burst forth in
solemn rapture to welcome them; no habit of their order
proclaimed to themselves and the world that they were the
elect of Christ, the brides of another life: but small, eating
cares, daily prosaic duties, the petty friction of all the littleness
and all the inglorious annoyances of every day, were
as dust that hid the beauty and grandeur of their calling
even from themselves; they walked unknown even to their
households, unknown even to their own souls; but when
the Lord comes to build his New Jerusalem, we shall find
many a white stone with a new name thereon, and the record
of deeds and words which only He that seeth in secret
knows. Many a humble soul will be amazed to find that
the seed it sowed in such weakness, in the dust of daily
life, has blossomed into immortal flowers under the eye of
the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I build my cathedral, that woman,&rdquo; I said, pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
to a small painting by the fire, &ldquo;shall be among the
first of my saints. You see her there, in an every-day dress-cap
with a mortal thread-lace border, and with a very ordinary
worked collar, fastened by a visible and terrestrial
breastpin. There is no nimbus around her head, no sign
of the cross upon her breast; her hands are clasped on no
crucifix or rosary. Her clear, keen, hazel eye looks as if it
could sparkle with mirthfulness, as in fact it could; there
are in it both the subtile flash of wit and the subdued light
of humor; and though the whole face smiles, it has yet a
certain decisive firmness that speaks the soul immutable in
good. That woman shall be the first saint in my cathedral,
and her name shall be recorded as Saint Esther. What
makes saintliness in my view, as distinguished from ordinary
goodness, is a certain quality of magnanimity and greatness
of soul that brings life within the circle of the heroic.
To be really great in little things, to be truly noble and
heroic in the insipid details of every-day life, is a virtue so
rare as to be worthy of canonization,&mdash;and this virtue was
hers. New England Puritanism must be credited with the
making of many such women. Severe as was her discipline,
and harsh as seems now her rule, we have yet to see whether
women will be born of modern systems of tolerance and indulgence
equal to those grand ones of the olden times whose
places now know them no more. The inconceivable austerity
and solemnity with which Puritanism invested this
mortal life, the awful grandeur of the themes which it made
household words, the sublimity of the issues which it hung
upon the commonest acts of our earthly existence, created
characters of more than Roman strength and greatness; and
the good men and women of Puritan training excelled the
saints of the Middle Ages, as a soul fully developed intellectually,
educated to closest thought, and exercised in reasoning,
is superior to a soul great merely through impulse
and sentiment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My earliest recollections of Aunt Esther, for so our
saint was known, were of a bright-faced, cheerful, witty,
quick-moving little middle-aged person, who came into our
house like a good fairy whenever there was a call of sickness
or trouble. If an accident happened in the great
roystering family of eight or ten children (and when was
not something happening to some of us?), and we were
shut up in a sick-room, then duly as daylight came the
quick step and cheerful face of Aunt Esther,&mdash;not solemn
and lugubrious like so many sick-room nurses, but with a
never failing flow of wit and story that could beguile even
the most doleful into laughing at their own afflictions. I
remember how a fit of the quinsy&mdash;most tedious of all
sicknesses to an active child&mdash;was gilded and glorified into
quite a fête by my having Aunt Esther all to myself for
two whole days, with nothing to do but amuse me. She
charmed me into smiling at the very pangs which had made
me weep before, and of which she described her own experiences
in a manner to make me think that, after all,
the quinsy was something with an amusing side to it. Her
knowledge of all sorts of medicines, gargles, and alleviatives,
her perfect familiarity with every canon and law of good
nursing and tending, was something that could only have
come from long experience in those good old New England
days when there were no nurses recognized as a class in the
land, but when watching and the care of the sick were
among those offices of Christian life which the families of a
neighborhood reciprocally rendered each other. Even from
early youth she had obeyed a special vocation as sister
of charity in many a sick-room, and, with the usual keen
intelligence of New England, had widened her powers of
doing good by the reading of medical and physiological
works. Her legends of nursing in those days of long typhus
fever and other formidable and protracted forms of disease
were to our ears quite wonderful, and we regarded her as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
sort of patron saint of the sick-room. She seemed always so
cheerful, so bright, and so devoted, that it never occurred to
us youngsters to doubt that she enjoyed, above all things,
being with us, waiting on us all day, watching over us by
night, telling us stories, and answering, in her lively and
always amusing and instructive way, that incessant fire of
questions with which a child persecutes a grown person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, as a reward of goodness, we were allowed
to visit her in her own room, a neat little parlor in the
neighborhood, whose windows looked down a hillside on
one hand, under the boughs of an apple-orchard, where
daisies and clover and bobolinks always abounded in summer
time; and on the other faced the street, with a green yard
flanked by one or two shady elms between them and the
street. No nun&rsquo;s cell was ever neater, no bee&rsquo;s cell ever
more compactly and carefully arranged; and to us, familiar
with the confusion of a great family of little ones, there
was always something inviting about its stillness, its perfect
order, and the air of thoughtful repose that breathed over
it. She lived there in perfect independence, doing, as it
was her delight to do, every office of life for herself. She
was her own cook, her own parlor and chamber maid, her
own laundress; and very faultless the cooking, washing,
ironing, and care of her premises were. A slice of Aunt
Esther&rsquo;s gingerbread, one of Aunt Esther&rsquo;s cookies, had, we
all believed, certain magical properties such as belonged to
no other mortal mixture. Even a handful of walnuts that
were brought from the depths of her mysterious closet had
virtues in our eyes such as no other walnuts could approach.
The little shelf of books that hung suspended by cords
against her wall was sacred in our regard; the volumes
were like no other books; and we supposed that she derived
from them those stores of knowledge on all subjects which
she unconsciously dispensed among us,&mdash;for she was
always telling us something of metals, or minerals, or gems,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
or plants, or animals, which awakened our curiosity, stimulated
our inquiries, and, above all, led us to wonder where
she had learned it all. Even the slight restrictions which
her neat habits imposed on our breezy and turbulent natures
seemed all quite graceful and becoming. It was right, in our
eyes, to cleanse our shoes on scraper and mat with extra diligence,
and then to place a couple of chips under the heels
of our boots when we essayed to dry our feet at her spotless
hearth. We marveled to see our own faces reflected in a
thousand smiles and winks from her bright brass andirons,&mdash;such
andirons we thought were seen on earth in no other
place,&mdash;and a pair of radiant brass candlesticks, that illustrated
the mantelpiece, were viewed with no less respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Esther&rsquo;s cat was a model for all cats,&mdash;so sleek,
so intelligent, so decorous and well-trained, always occupying
exactly her own cushion by the fire, and never transgressing
in one iota the proprieties belonging to a cat of good breeding.
She shared our affections with her mistress, and we
were allowed as a great favor and privilege, now and then,
to hold the favorite on our knees, and stroke her satin coat
to a smoother gloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not for cats alone that she had attractions.
She was in sympathy and fellowship with everything that
moved and lived; knew every bird and beast with a friendly
acquaintanceship. The squirrels that inhabited the trees in
the front yard were won in time by her blandishments to
come and perch on her window-sills, and thence, by trains
of nuts adroitly laid, to disport themselves on the shining
cherry tea-table that stood between the windows; and we
youngsters used to sit entranced with delight as they gamboled
and waved their feathery tails in frolicsome security,
eating rations of gingerbread and bits of seedcake with as
good a relish as any child among us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habits, the rights, the wrongs, the wants, and the
sufferings of the animal creation formed the subject of many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
an interesting conversation with her; and we boys, with the
natural male instinct of hunting, trapping, and pursuing,
were often made to pause in our career, remembering her
pleas for the dumb things which could not speak for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her little hermitage was the favorite resort of numerous
friends. Many of the young girls who attended the village
academy made her acquaintance, and nothing delighted her
more than that they should come there and read to her the
books they were studying, when her superior and wide information
enabled her to light up and explain much that
was not clear to the immature students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her shady retirement, too, she was a sort of Egeria
to certain men of genius, who came to read to her their
writings, to consult her in their arguments, and to discuss
with her the literature and politics of the day,&mdash;through
all which her mind moved with an equal step, yet with a
sprightliness and vivacity peculiarly feminine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her memory was remarkably retentive, not only of the
contents of books, but of all that great outlying fund of
anecdote and story which the quaint and earnest New England
life always supplied. There were pictures of peculiar
characters, legends of true events stranger than romance, all
stored in the cabinets of her mind; and these came from her
lips with the greater force because the precision of her memory
enabled her to authenticate them with name, date, and
circumstances of vivid reality. From that shadowy line of
incidents which marks the twilight boundary between the
spiritual world and the present life she drew legends of
peculiar clearness, but invested with the mysterious charm
which always dwells in that uncertain region; and the shrewd
flash of her eye, and the keen, bright smile with which she
answered the wondering question, &lsquo;What <i>do</i> you suppose it
was?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;What could it have been?&rsquo; showed how evenly
rationalism in her mind kept pace with romance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The retired room in which she thus read, studied,
thought, and surveyed from afar the whole world of science
and literature, and in which she received friends and entertained
children, was perhaps the dearest and freshest spot
to her in the world. There came a time, however, when
the neat little independent establishment was given up, and
she went to associate herself with two of her nieces in keeping
house for a boarding-school of young girls. Here her
lively manners and her gracious interest in the young made
her a universal favorite, though the cares she assumed broke
in upon those habits of solitude and study which formed
her delight. From the day that she surrendered this independency
of hers, she had never, for more than a score of
years, a home of her own, but filled the trying position of
an accessory in the home of others. Leaving the boarding-school,
she became the helper of an invalid wife and mother
in the early nursing and rearing of a family of young
children,&mdash;an office which leaves no privacy and no leisure.
Her bed was always shared with some little one; her territories
were exposed to the constant inroads of little pattering
feet; and all the various sicknesses and ailments of
delicate childhood made absorbing drafts upon her time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while she left New England with the brother
to whose family she devoted herself. The failing health of
the wife and mother left more and more the charge of all
things in her hands; servants were poor, and all the appliances
of living had the rawness and inconvenience which in
those days attended Western life. It became her fate to
supply all other people&rsquo;s defects and deficiencies. Wherever
a hand failed, there must her hand be. Whenever a foot
faltered, she must step into the ranks. She was the one
who thought for and cared for and toiled for all, yet made
never a claim that any one should care for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not till late in my life that I became acquainted
with the deep interior sacrifice, the constant self-abnegation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
which all her life involved. She was born with a strong,
vehement, impulsive nature,&mdash;a nature both proud and
sensitive,&mdash;a nature whose tastes were passions, whose likings
and whose aversions were of the most intense and positive
character. Devoted as she always seemed to the mere
practical and material, she had naturally a deep romance
and enthusiasm of temperament which exceeded all that can
be written in novels. It was chiefly owing to this that a
home and a central affection of her own were never hers. In
her early days of attractiveness, none who would have sought
her could meet the high requirements of her ideality; she
never saw her hero, and so never married. Family cares,
the tending of young children, she often confessed, were
peculiarly irksome to her. She had the head of a student,
a passionate love for the world of books. A Protestant convent,
where she might devote herself without interruption
to study, was her ideal of happiness. She had, too, the
keenest appreciation of poetry, of music, of painting, and of
natural scenery. Her enjoyment in any of these things was
intensely vivid whenever, by chance, a stray sunbeam of the
kind darted across the dusty path of her life; yet in all
these her life was a constant repression. The eagerness with
which she would listen to any account from those more fortunate
ones who had known these things, showed how ardent
a passion was constantly held in check. A short time
before her death, talking with a friend who had visited
Switzerland, she said, with great feeling: &lsquo;All my life my
desire to visit the beautiful places of this earth has been so
intense, that I cannot but hope that after my death I shall
be permitted to go and look at them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The completeness of her self-discipline may be gathered
from the fact that no child could ever be brought to believe
she had not a natural fondness for children, or that she
found the care of them burdensome. It was easy to see that
she had naturally all those particular habits, those minute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
pertinacities in respect to her daily movements and the arrangement
of all her belongings, which would make the meddling,
intrusive demands of infancy and childhood peculiarly
hard for her to meet. Yet never was there a pair of toddling
feet that did not make free with Aunt Esther&rsquo;s room,
never a curly head that did not look up, in confiding assurance
of a welcome smile, to her bright eyes. The inconsiderate
and never ceasing requirements of children and invalids
never drew from her other than a cheerful response; and
to my mind there is more saintship in this than in the private
wearing of any number of haircloth shirts or belts lined
with spikes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a large family of careless, noisy children there will
be constant losing of thimbles and needles and scissors; but
Aunt Esther was always ready, without reproach, to help
the careless and the luckless. Her things, so well kept and
so treasured, she was willing to lend, with many a caution
and injunction, it is true, but also with a relish of right
good will. And, to do us justice, we generally felt the
sacredness of the trust, and were more careful of her things
than of our own. If a shade of sewing-silk were wanting,
or a choice button, or a bit of braid or tape, Aunt Esther
cheerfully volunteered something from her well-kept stores,
not regarding the trouble she made herself in seeking the
key, unlocking the drawer, and searching out in bag or parcel
just the treasure demanded. Never was more perfect
precision, or more perfect readiness to accommodate others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her little income, scarcely reaching a hundred dollars
yearly, was disposed of with a generosity worthy a fortune.
One tenth was sacredly devoted to charity, and a still
further sum laid by every year for presents to friends. No
Christmas or New Year ever came round that Aunt Esther,
out of this very tiny fund, did not find something for children
and servants. Her gifts were trifling in value, but
well timed,&mdash;a ball of thread-wax, a paper of pins, a pin-cushion,&mdash;something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span>
generally so well chosen as to show
that she had been running over our needs, and noting what
to give. She was no less gracious as receiver than as giver.
The little articles that we made for her, or the small presents
that we could buy out of our childish resources, she always
declared were exactly what she needed; and she delighted us
by the care she took of them and the value she set upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her income was a source of the greatest pleasure to her,
as maintaining an independence without which she could
not have been happy. Though she constantly gave to
every family in which she lived services which no money
could repay, it would have been the greatest trial to her
not to be able to provide for herself. Her dress, always
that of a true gentlewoman,&mdash;refined, quiet, and neat,&mdash;was
bought from this restricted sum, and her small traveling
expenses were paid out of it. She abhorred anything false
or flashy: her caps were trimmed with real thread lace, and
her silk dresses were of the best quality, perfectly well made
and kept; and, after all, a little sum always remained over
in her hands for unforeseen exigencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This love of independence was one of the strongest
features of her life, and we often playfully told her that
her only form of selfishness was the monopoly of saintship,&mdash;that
she who gave so much was not willing to allow
others to give to her; that she who made herself servant of
all was not willing to allow others to serve her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the trials of her life must be reckoned much ill
health, borne, however, with such heroic patience that it was
not easy to say when the hand of pain was laid upon her. She
inherited, too, a tendency to depression of spirits, which at
times increased to a morbid and distressing gloom. Few
knew or suspected these sufferings, so completely had she
learned to suppress every outward manifestation that might
interfere with the happiness of others. In her hours of
depression she resolutely forbore to sadden the lives of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
those around her with her own melancholy, and often her
darkest moods were so lighted up and adorned with an outside
show of wit and humor, that those who had known her
intimately were astonished to hear that she had ever been
subject to depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her truthfulness of nature amounted almost to superstition.
From her promise once given she felt no change
of purpose could absolve her; and therefore rarely would
she give it absolutely, for she <i>could not</i> alter the thing that
had gone forth from her lips. Our belief in the certainty of
her fulfilling her word was like our belief in the immutability
of the laws of nature. Whoever asked her got of her
the absolute truth on every subject, and, when she had no
good thing to say, her silence was often truly awful. When
anything mean or ungenerous was brought to her knowledge,
she would close her lips resolutely; but the flash in her
eyes showed what she would speak were speech permitted.
In her last days she spoke to a friend of what she had
suffered from the strength of her personal antipathies. &lsquo;I
thank God,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I believe at last I have overcome
all that too, and that there has not been, for some
years, any human being toward whom I have felt a movement
of dislike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last year of her life was a constant discipline of
unceasing pain, borne with that fortitude which could make
her an entertaining and interesting companion even while
the sweat of mortal agony was starting from her brow.
Her own room she kept as a last asylum, to which she
would silently retreat when the torture became too intense
for the repression of society, and there alone, with closed
doors, she wrestled with her agony. The stubborn independence
of her nature took refuge in this final fastness, and
she prayed only that she might go down to death with the
full ability to steady herself all the way, needing the help
of no other hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The ultimate struggle of earthly feeling came when this
proud self-reliance was forced to give way, and she was
obliged to leave herself helpless in the hands of others.
&lsquo;God requires that I should give up my last form of self-will,&rsquo;
she said; &lsquo;now I have resigned this, perhaps He will let
me go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a good old age, Death, the friend, came and opened
the door of this mortal state, and a great soul, that had
served a long appenticeship to little things, went forth into
the joy of its Lord; a life of self-sacrifice and self-abnegation
passed into a life of endless rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Rudolph, &ldquo;I rebel at this life of self-abnegation
and self-sacrifice. I do not think it the duty of noble
women, who have beautiful natures and enlarged and cultivated
tastes, to make themselves the slaves of the sick-room
and nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such was not the teaching of our New England faith,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Absolute unselfishness,&mdash;the death of self,&mdash;such
were its teachings, and such as Esther&rsquo;s the characters
it made. &lsquo;Do the duty nearest thee&rsquo; was the only message
it gave to &lsquo;women with a mission;&rsquo; and from duty
to duty, from one self-denial to another, they rose to a
majesty of moral strength impossible to any form of mere
self-indulgence. It is of souls thus sculptured and chiseled
by self-denial and self-discipline that the living temple
of the perfect hereafter is to be built. The pain of the
discipline is short, but the glory of the fruition is eternal.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>XII <br /><br />THE NEW YEAR <br /><br />[1865.]</h3>
</div>
<p>Here comes the First of January, Eighteen Hundred
and Sixty-Five, and we are all settled comfortably into our
winter places, with our winter surroundings and belongings;
all cracks and openings are calked and listed, the double
windows are in, the furnace dragon in the cellar is ruddy
and in good liking, sending up his warming respirations
through every pipe and register in the house; and yet,
though an artificial summer reigns everywhere, like bees
we have our swarming place,&mdash;in my library. There is my
chimney-corner, and my table permanently established on
one side of the hearth; and each of the female genus has, so
to speak, pitched her own winter tent within sight of the
blaze of my camp-fire. I discerned to-day that Jenny had
surreptitiously appropriated one of the drawers of my study-table
to knitting-needles and worsted; and wicker work-baskets
and stands of various heights and sizes seem to be
planted here and there for permanence among the bookcases.
The canary-bird has a sunny window, and the plants spread
out their leaves and unfold their blossoms as if there were
no ice and snow in the street, and Rover makes a hearth-rug
of himself in winking satisfaction in front of my fire,
except when Jenny is taken with a fit of discipline, when
he beats a retreat, and secretes himself under my table.</p>
<p>Peaceable, ah, how peaceable, home and quiet and
warmth in winter! And how, when we hear the wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
whistle, we think of you, O our brave brothers, our saviors
and defenders, who for our sake have no home but the
muddy camp, the hard pillow of the barrack, the weary
march, the uncertain fare,&mdash;you, the rank and file, the
thousand unnoticed ones, who have left warm fires, dear
wives, loving little children, without even the hope of glory
or fame,&mdash;without even the hope of doing anything remarkable
or perceptible for the cause you love,&mdash;resigned
only to fill the ditch or bridge the chasm over which your
country shall walk to peace and joy! Good men and
true, brave unknown hearts, we salute you, and feel that
we, in our soft peace and security, are not worthy of you!
When we think of you, our simple comforts seem luxuries
all too good for us, who give so little when you give
all!</p>
<p>But there are others to whom from our bright homes,
our cheerful firesides, we would fain say a word, if we
dared.</p>
<p>Think of a mother receiving a letter with such a passage
as this in it! It is extracted from one we have just seen,
written by a private in the army of Sheridan, describing
the death of a private. &ldquo;He fell instantly, gave a peculiar
smile and look, and then closed his eyes. We laid him
down gently at the foot of a large tree. I crossed his
hands over his breast, closed his eyelids down, but the
smile was still on his face. I wrapt him in his tent, spread
my pocket-handkerchief over his face, wrote his name on a
piece of paper, and pinned it on his breast, and there we
left him: we could not find pick or shovel to dig a grave.&rdquo;
There it is!&mdash;a history that is multiplying itself by hundreds
daily, the substance of what has come to so many
homes, and must come to so many more before the great
price of our ransom is paid!</p>
<p>What can we say to you, in those many, many homes
where the light has gone out forever?&mdash;you, O fathers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_427' name='page_427'></a>427</span>
mothers, wives, sisters, haunted by a name that has ceased
to be spoken on earth,&mdash;you, for whom there is no more
news from the camp, no more reading of lists, no more
tracing of maps, no more letters, but only a blank, dead
silence! The battlecry goes on, but for you it is passed
by! the victory comes, but, oh, never more to bring him
back to you! your offering to this great cause has been
made, and been taken; you have thrown into it <i>all</i> your
living, even all that you had, and from henceforth your
house is left unto you desolate! O ye watchers of the
cross, ye waiters by the sepulchre, what can be said to you?
We could almost extinguish our own home-fires, that seem
too bright when we think of your darkness; the laugh
dies on our lip, the lamp burns dim through our tears, and
we seem scarcely worthy to speak words of comfort, lest we
seem as those who mock a grief they cannot know.</p>
<p>But is there no consolation? Is it nothing to have had
such a treasure to give, and to have given it freely for the
noblest cause for which ever battle was set,&mdash;for the salvation
of your country, for the freedom of all mankind?
Had he died a fruitless death, in the track of common life,
blasted by fever, smitten or rent by crushing accident, then
might his most precious life seem to be as water spilled
upon the ground; but now it has been given for a cause
and a purpose worthy even the anguish of your loss and
sacrifice. He has been counted worthy to be numbered
with those who stood with precious incense between the living
and the dead, that the plague which was consuming us
might be stayed. The blood of these young martyrs shall
be the seed of the future church of liberty, and from every
drop shall spring up flowers of healing. O widow! O
mother! blessed among bereaved women! there remains to
you a treasure that belongs not to those who have lost in
any other wise,&mdash;the power to say, &ldquo;He died for his country.&rdquo;
In all the good that comes of this anguish you shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span>
have a right and share by virtue of this sacrifice. The joy
of freedmen bursting from chains, the glory of a nation
new-born, the assurance of a triumphant future for your
country and the world,&mdash;all these become yours by the
purchase-money of that precious blood.</p>
<p>Besides this, there are other treasures that come through
sorrow, and sorrow alone. There are celestial plants of
root so long and so deep that the land must be torn and
furrowed, ploughed up from the very foundation, before
they can strike and nourish; and when we see how God&rsquo;s
plough is driving backward and forward and across this
nation, rending, tearing up tender shoots, and burying soft
wild-flowers, we ask ourselves, What is He going to plant?</p>
<p>Not the first year, nor the second, after the ground has
been broken up, does the purpose of the husbandman appear.
At first we see only what is uprooted and ploughed
in,&mdash;the daisy drabbled, and the violet crushed,&mdash;and the
first trees planted amid the unsightly furrows stand dumb
and disconsolate, irresolute in leaf, and without flower or
fruit. Their work is under the ground. In darkness and
silence they are putting forth long fibres, searching hither
and thither under the black soil for the strength that years
hence shall burst into bloom and bearing.</p>
<p>What is true of nations is true of individuals. It may
seem now winter and desolation with you. Your hearts
have been ploughed and harrowed and are now frozen up.
There is not a flower left, not a blade of grass, not a bird
to sing,&mdash;and it is hard to believe that any brighter flowers,
any greener herbage, shall spring up than those which
have been torn away; and yet there will. Nature herself
teaches you to-day. Outdoors nothing but bare branches
and shrouding snow; and yet you know that there is not
a tree that is not patiently holding out at the end of its
boughs next year&rsquo;s buds, frozen indeed, but unkilled. The
rhododendron and the lilac have their blossoms all ready,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
wrapped in cere-cloth, waiting in patient faith. Under the
frozen ground the crocus and the hyacinth and the tulip
hide in their hearts the perfect forms of future flowers.
And it is even so with you: your leaf buds of the future
are frozen, but not killed; the soil of your heart has many
flowers under it cold and still now, but they will yet come
up and bloom.</p>
<p>The dear old book of comfort tells of no present healing
for sorrow. No chastening for the present seemeth joyous,
but grievous, but afterwards it yieldeth peaceable fruits
of righteousness. We, as individuals, as a nation, need to
have faith in that <span class='smcaplc'>AFTERWARDS</span>. It is sure to come,&mdash;sure
as spring and summer to follow winter.</p>
<p>There is a certain amount of suffering which must follow
the rending of the great cords of life, suffering which is natural
and inevitable; it cannot be argued down; it cannot
be stilled; it can no more be soothed by any effort of faith
and reason than the pain of a fractured limb, or the agony
of fire on the living flesh. All that we can do is to brace
ourselves to bear it, calling on God, as the martyrs did in
the fire, and resigning ourselves to let it burn on. We
must be willing to suffer, since God so wills. There are
just so many waves to go over us, just so many arrows of
stinging thought to be shot into our soul, just so many
faintings and sinkings and revivings only to suffer again,
belonging to and inherent in our portion of sorrow; and
there is a work of healing that God has placed in the hands
of Time alone.</p>
<p>Time heals all things at last; yet it depends much on
us in our suffering, whether time shall send us forth healed,
indeed, but maimed and crippled and callous, or whether,
looking to the great Physician of sorrows, and co-working
with him, we come forth stronger and fairer even for our
wounds.</p>
<p>We call ourselves a Christian people, and the peculiarity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
of Christianity is that it is a worship and doctrine of sorrow.
The five wounds of Jesus, the instruments of the
passion, the cross, the sepulchre,&mdash;these are its emblems
and watchwords. In thousands of churches, amid gold
and gems and altars fragrant with perfume, are seen the
crown of thorns, the nails, the spear, the cup of vinegar
mingled with gall, the sponge that could not slake that
burning death-thirst; and in a voice choked with anguish
the Church in many lands and divers tongues prays from
age to age, &ldquo;By thine agony and bloody sweat, by thy
cross and passion, by thy precious death and burial!&rdquo;&mdash;mighty
words of comfort, whose meaning reveals itself only
to souls fainting in the cold death-sweat of mortal anguish!
They tell all Christians that by uttermost distress alone
was the Captain of their salvation made perfect as a Saviour.</p>
<p>Sorrow brings us into the true unity of the Church,&mdash;that
unity which underlies all external creeds, and unites
all hearts that have suffered deeply enough to know that
when sorrow is at its utmost there is but one kind of sorrow,
and but one remedy. What matter, <i>in extremis</i>,
whether we be called Romanist, or Protestant, or Greek, or
Calvinist?</p>
<p>We suffer, and Christ suffered; we die, and Christ died;
he conquered suffering and death, he rose and lives and
reigns,&mdash;and we shall conquer, rise, live, and reign. The
hours on the cross were long, the thirst was bitter, the darkness
and horror real,&mdash;<i>but they ended</i>. After the wail,
&ldquo;My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; came the calm,
&ldquo;It is finished;&rdquo; pledge to us all that our &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;
shall come also.</p>
<p>Christ arose, fresh, joyous, no more to die; and it is
written that, when the disciples were gathered together in
fear and sorrow, he stood in the midst of them, and showed
unto them his hands and his side; and then were they glad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
Already had the healed wounds of Jesus become pledges of
consolation to innumerable thousands; and those who, like
Christ, have suffered the weary struggles, the dim horrors
of the cross,&mdash;who have lain, like him, cold and chilled in
the hopeless sepulchre,&mdash;if his spirit wakes them to life,
shall come forth with healing power for others who have
suffered and are suffering.</p>
<p>Count the good and beautiful ministrations that have
been wrought in this world of need and labor, and how
many of them have been wrought by hands wounded and
scarred, by hearts that had scarcely ceased to bleed!</p>
<p>How many priests of consolation is God now ordaining
by the fiery imposition of sorrow! how many Sisters of the
Bleeding Heart, Daughters of Mercy, Sisters of Charity, are
receiving their first vocation in tears and blood!</p>
<p>The report of every battle strikes into some home; and
heads fall low, and hearts are shattered, and only God sees
the joy that is set before them, and that shall come out of
their sorrow. He sees our morning at the same moment
that He sees our night,&mdash;sees us comforted, healed, risen
to a higher life, at the same moment that He sees us crushed
and broken in the dust; and so, though tenderer than we,
He bears our great sorrows for the joy that is set before us.</p>
<p>After the Napoleonic wars had desolated Europe, the
country was, like all countries after war, full of shattered
households, of widows and orphans and homeless wanderers.
A nobleman of Silesia, the Baron von Kottwitz, who had
lost his wife and all his family in the reverses and sorrows
of the times, found himself alone in the world, which looked
more dreary and miserable through the multiplying lenses
of his own tears. But he was one of those whose heart
had been quickened in its death anguish by the resurrection
voice of Christ; and he came forth to life and comfort.
He bravely resolved to do all that one man could to lessen
the great sum of misery. He sold his estates in Silesia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span>
bought in Berlin a large building that had been used as
barracks for the soldiers, and, fitting it up in plain, commodious
apartments, formed there a great family-establishment,
into which he received the wrecks and fragments of families
that had been broken up by the war,&mdash;orphan children,
widowed and helpless women, decrepit old people, disabled
soldiers. These he made his family, and constituted himself
their father and chief. He abode with them, and cared
for them as a parent. He had schools for the children; the
more advanced he put to trades and employments; he set
up a hospital for the sick; and for all he had the priestly
ministrations of his own Christ-like heart. The celebrated
Professor Tholuck, one of the most learned men of modern
Germany, was an early protégé of the old Baron&rsquo;s, who, discerning
his talents, put him in the way of a liberal education.
In his earlier years, like many others of the young
who play with life, ignorant of its needs, Tholuck piqued
himself on a lordly skepticism with regard to the commonly
received Christianity, and even wrote an essay to prove the
superiority of the Mohammedan to the Christian religion.
In speaking of his conversion, he says,&mdash;&ldquo;What moved
me was no argument, nor any spoken reproof, but simply
that divine image of the old Baron walking before my soul.
That life was an argument always present to me, and which
I never could answer; and so I became a Christian.&rdquo; In
the life of this man we see the victory over sorrow. How
many with means like his, when desolated by like bereavements,
have lain coldly and idly gazing on the miseries of
life, and weaving around themselves icy tissues of doubt
and despair,&mdash;doubting the being of a God, doubting the
reality of a Providence, doubting the divine love, embittered
and rebellious against the power which they could not resist,
yet to which they would not submit! In such a chill
heart-freeze lies the danger of sorrow. And it is a mortal
danger. It is a torpor that must be resisted, as the man in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
the whirling snows must bestir himself, or he will perish.
The apathy of melancholy must be broken by an effort of
religion and duty. The stagnant blood must be made to flow
by active work, and the cold hand warmed by clasping the
hands outstretched towards it in sympathy or supplication.
One orphan child taken in, to be fed, clothed, and nurtured,
may save a heart from freezing to death: and God knows
this war is making but too many orphans!</p>
<p>It is easy to subscribe to an orphan asylum, and go on
in one&rsquo;s despair and loneliness. Such ministries may do good
to the children who are thereby saved from the street, but
they impart little warmth and comfort to the giver. One
destitute child housed, taught, cared for, and tended personally,
will bring more solace to a suffering heart than a dozen
maintained in an asylum. Not that the child will probably
prove an angel, or even an uncommonly interesting mortal.
It is a prosaic work, this bringing-up of children, and there
can be little rose-water in it. The child may not appreciate
what is done for him, may not be particularly grateful, may
have disagreeable faults, and continue to have them after
much pains on your part to eradicate them,&mdash;and yet it is
a fact, that to redeem one human being from destitution
and ruin, even in some homely every-day course of ministrations,
is one of the best possible tonics and alteratives to
a sick and wounded spirit.</p>
<p>But this is not the only avenue to beneficence which the
war opens. We need but name the service of hospitals, the
care and education of the freedmen,&mdash;for these are charities
that have long been before the eyes of the community,
and have employed thousands of busy hands: thousands of
sick and dying beds to tend, a race to be educated, civilized,
and Christianized, surely were work enough for one age; and
yet this is not all. War shatters everything, and it is hard
to say what in society will not need rebuilding and binding
up and strengthening anew. Not the least of the evils of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
war are the vices which a great army engenders wherever it
moves,&mdash;vices peculiar to military life, as others are peculiar
to peace. The poor soldier perils for us not merely his
body, but his soul. He leads a life of harassing and exhausting
toil and privation, of violent strain on the nervous energies,
alternating with sudden collapse, creating a craving for
stimulants, and endangering the formation of fatal habits.
What furies and harpies are those that follow the army,
and that seek out the soldier in his tent, far from home, mother,
wife and sister, tired, disheartened, and tempt him to
forget his troubles in a momentary exhilaration, that burns
only to chill and to destroy! Evil angels are always active
and indefatigable, and there must be good angels enlisted to
face them; and here is employment for the slack hand of grief.
Ah, we have known mothers bereft of sons in this war, who
have seemed at once to open wide their hearts, and to become
mothers to every brave soldier in the field. They
have lived only to work,&mdash;and in place of one lost, their
sons have been counted by thousands.</p>
<p>And not least of all the fields for exertion and Christian
charity opened by this war is that presented by womanhood.
The war is abstracting from the community its protecting
and sheltering elements, and leaving the helpless and dependent
in vast disproportion. For years to come, the average
of lone women will be largely increased; and the demand,
always great, for some means by which they may provide
for themselves, in the rude jostle of the world, will become
more urgent and imperative.</p>
<p>Will any one sit pining away in inert grief, when two
streets off are the midnight dance-houses, where girls of
twelve, thirteen, and fourteen are being lured into the way
of swift destruction? How many of these are daughters
of soldiers who have given their hearts&rsquo; blood for us and
our liberties!</p>
<p>Two noble women of the Society of Friends have lately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span>
been taking the gauge of suffering and misery in our land,
visiting the hospitals at every accessible point, pausing in
our great cities, and going in their purity to those midnight
orgies where mere children are being trained for a life of vice
and infamy. They have talked with these poor bewildered
souls, entangled in toils as terrible and inexorable as those
of the slave-market, and many of whom are frightened and
distressed at the life they are beginning to lead, and earnestly
looking for the means of escape. In the judgment
of these holy women, at least one third of those with whom
they have talked are children so recently entrapped, and so
capable of reformation, that there would be the greatest
hope in efforts for their salvation. While such things are
to be done in our land, is there any reason why any one
should die of grief? One soul redeemed will do more to lift
the burden of sorrow than all the blandishments and diversions
of art, all the alleviations of luxury, all the sympathy
of friends.</p>
<p>In the Roman Catholic Church there is an order of women
called the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, who have
renounced the world to devote themselves, their talents and
property, entirely to the work of seeking out and saving
the fallen of their own sex; and the wonders worked by
their self-denying love on the hearts and lives of even the
most depraved are credible only to those who know that
the Good Shepherd himself ever lives and works with such
spirits engaged in such a work. A similar order of women
exists in New York, under the direction of the Episcopal
Church, in connection with St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital; and another
in England, who tend the &ldquo;House of Mercy&rdquo; of
Clewer.</p>
<p>Such benevolent associations offer objects of interest to
that class which most needs something to fill the void made
by bereavement. The wounds of grief are less apt to find
a cure in that rank of life where the sufferer has wealth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span>
leisure. The <i>poor</i> widow, whoso husband was her all, <i>must</i>
break the paralysis of grief. The hard necessities of life are
her physicians; they send her out to unwelcome, yet friendly
toil, which, hard as it seems, has yet its healing power.
But the sufferer surrounded by the appliances of wealth and
luxury may long indulge the baleful apathy, and remain in
the damp shadows of the valley of death till strength and
health are irrecoverably lost. How Christ-like is the thought
of a woman, graceful, elegant, cultivated, refined, whose voice
has been trained to melody, whose fingers can make sweet
harmony with every touch, whose pencil and whose needle
can awake the beautiful creations of art, devoting all these
powers to the work of charming back to the sheepfold those
wandering and bewildered lambs whom the Good Shepherd
still calls his own! Jenny Lind once, when she sang at a
concert for destitute children, exclaimed in her enthusiasm,
&ldquo;Is it not beautiful that I can sing so?&rdquo; And so may not
every woman feel, when her graces and accomplishments
draw the wanderer, and charm away evil demons, and soothe
the sore and sickened spirit, and make the Christian fold
more attractive than the dizzy gardens of false pleasure?</p>
<p>In such associations, and others of kindred nature, how
many of the stricken and bereaved women of our country
might find at once a home and an object in life! Motherless
hearts might be made glad in a better and higher motherhood;
and the stock of earthly life that seemed cut off at
the root, and dead past recovery, may be grafted upon with
a shoot from the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.</p>
<p>So the beginning of this eventful 1865, which finds us
still treading the wine-press of our great conflict, should
bring with it a serene and solemn hope, a joy such as those
had with whom in the midst of the fiery furnace there
walked one like unto the Son of God.</p>
<p>The great affliction that has come upon our country is so
evidently the purifying chastening of a Father, rather than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
the avenging anger of a Destroyer, that all hearts may submit
themselves in a solemn and holy calm still to bear the burning
that shall make us clean from dross and bring us forth
to a higher national life. Never, in the whole course of our
history, have such teachings of the pure abstract Right been
so commended and forced upon us by Providence. Never
have public men been so constrained to humble themselves
before God, and to acknowledge that there is a Judge that
ruleth in the earth. Verily his inquisition for blood has
been strict and awful; and for every stricken household of
the poor and lowly hundreds of households of the oppressor
have been scattered. The land where the family of the slave
was first annihilated, and the negro, with all the loves and
hopes of a man, was proclaimed to be a beast to be bred and
sold in market with the horse and the swine,&mdash;that land,
with its fair name, Virginia, has been made a desolation so
signal, so wonderful, that the blindest passer-by cannot but
ask for what sin so awful a doom has been meted out. The
prophetic visions of Nat Turner, who saw the leaves drop
blood and the land darkened, have been fulfilled. The work
of justice which he predicted is being executed to the uttermost.</p>
<p>But when this strange work of judgment and justice is
consummated, when our country, through a thousand battles
and ten thousands of precious deaths, shall have come forth
from this long agony, redeemed and regenerated, then God
himself shall return and dwell with us, and the Lord God
shall wipe away all tears from all faces, and the rebuke of
his people shall he utterly take away.</p>

<h3>XIII <br /><br />THE NOBLE ARMY OF MARTYRS</h3>
</div>
<p>When the first number of the Chimney-Corner appeared,
the snow lay white on the ground, the buds on the trees
were closed and frozen, and beneath the hard frost-bound
soil lay buried the last year&rsquo;s flower-roots, waiting for a
resurrection.</p>
<p>So in our hearts it was winter,&mdash;a winter of patient suffering
and expectancy,&mdash;a winter of suppressed sobs, of
inward bleedings,&mdash;a cold, choked, compressed anguish of
endurance, for how long and how much God only could tell
us.</p>
<p>The first paper of the Chimney-Corner, as was most meet
and fitting, was given to those homes made sacred and venerable
by the cross of martyrdom,&mdash;by the chrism of a
great sorrow. That Chimney-Corner made bright by home
firelight seemed a fitting place for a solemn act of reverent
sympathy for the homes by whose darkness our homes had
been preserved bright, by whose emptiness our homes had
been kept full, by whose losses our homes had been enriched;
and so we ventured with trembling to utter these words of
sympathy and cheer to those whom God had chosen to this
great sacrifice of sorrow.</p>
<p>The winter months passed with silent footsteps, spring
returned, and the sun, with ever waxing power, unsealed
the snowy sepulchre of buds and leaves,&mdash;birds reappeared,
brooks were unchained, flowers filled every desolate dell
with blossoms and perfume. And with returning spring, in
like manner, the chill frost of our fears and of our dangers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
melted before the breath of the Lord. The great war, which
lay like a mountain of ice upon our hearts, suddenly dissolved
and was gone. The fears of the past were as a dream
when one awaketh, and now we scarce realize our deliverance.
A thousand hopes are springing up everywhere, like
spring flowers in the forest. All is hopefulness, all is bewildering
joy.</p>
<p>But this our joy has been ordained to be changed into a
wail of sorrow. The kind hard hand, that held the helm
so steadily in the desperate tossings of the storm, has been
stricken down just as we entered port,&mdash;the fatherly heart
that bore all our sorrows can take no earthly part in our
joys. His were the cares, the watchings, the toils, the
agonies, of a nation in mortal struggle; and God, looking
down, was so well pleased with his humble faithfulness,
his patient continuance in well-doing, that earthly rewards
and honors seemed all too poor for him, so he reached
down and took him to immortal glories. &ldquo;Well done,
good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henceforth the place of Abraham Lincoln is first among
that noble army of martyrs who have given their blood to
the cause of human freedom. The eyes are yet too dim
with tears that would seek calmly to trace out his place in
history. He has been a marvel and a phenomenon among
statesmen, a new kind of ruler in the earth. There has
been something even unearthly about his extreme unselfishness,
his utter want of personal ambition, personal self-valuation,
personal feeling.</p>
<p>The most unsparing criticism, denunciation, and ridicule
never moved him to a single bitter expression, never seemed
to awaken in him a single bitter thought. The most exultant
hour of party victory brought no exultation to him; he
accepted power not as an honor, but as a responsibility; and
when, after a severe struggle, that power came a second time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
into his hands, there was something preternatural in the
calmness of his acceptance of it. The first impulse seemed
to be a disclaimer of all triumph over the party that had
strained their utmost to push him from his seat, and then
a sober girding up of his loins to go on with the work to
which he was appointed. His last inaugural was characterized
by a tone so peculiarly solemn and free from earthly
passion, that it seems to us now, who look back on it in the
light of what has followed, as if his soul had already parted
from earthly things, and felt the powers of the world to
come. It was not the formal state paper of the chief of
a party in an hour of victory, so much as the solemn soliloquy
of a great soul reviewing its course under a vast responsibility,
and appealing from all earthly judgments to
the tribunal of Infinite Justice. It was the solemn clearing
of his soul for the great sacrament of Death, and the
words that he quoted in it with such thrilling power were
those of the adoring spirits that veil their faces before the
throne,&mdash;&ldquo;Just and true are thy ways, thou King of
saints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the rich treasures which this bitter struggle has
brought to our country, not the least is the moral wealth
which has come to us in the memory of our martyrs.
Thousands of men, women, and children too, in this great
conflict, have &ldquo;endured tortures, not accepting deliverance,&rdquo;
counting not their lives dear unto them in the holy cause;
and they have done this as understandingly and thoughtfully
as the first Christians who sealed their witness with their
blood.</p>
<p>Let us in our hour of deliverance and victory record the
solemn vow, that our right hand shall forget her cunning
before we forget them and their sufferings,&mdash;that our tongue
shall cleave to the roof of our mouth if we remember them
not above our chief joy.</p>
<p>Least suffering among that noble band were those who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
laid down their lives on the battlefield, to whom was given
a brief and speedy passage to the victor&rsquo;s meed. The mourners
who mourn for such as these must give place to another
and more august band, who have sounded lower deeps of
anguish, and drained bitterer drops out of our great cup of
trembling.</p>
<p>The narrative of the lingering tortures, indignities, and
sufferings of our soldiers in Rebel prisons has been something
so harrowing that we have not dared to dwell upon it. We
have been helplessly dumb before it, and have turned away our
eyes from what we could not relieve, and therefore could not
endure to look upon. But now, when the nation is called
to strike the great and solemn balance of justice, and to decide
measures of final retribution, it behooves us all that we
should at least watch with our brethren for one hour, and
take into our account what they have been made to suffer
for us.</p>
<p>Sterne said he could realize the miseries of captivity only
by setting before him the image of a miserable captive with
hollow cheek and wasted eye, notching upon a stick, day
after day, the weary record of the flight of time. So we
can form a more vivid picture of the sufferings of our martyrs
from one simple story than from any general description;
and therefore we will speak right on, and tell one
story which might stand as a specimen of what has been
done and suffered by thousands.</p>
<p>In the town of Andover, Massachusetts, a boy of sixteen,
named Walter Raymond, enlisted among our volunteers.
He was under the prescribed age, but his eager zeal led him
to follow the footsteps of an elder brother who had already
enlisted; and the father of the boy, though these two were
all the sons he had, instead of availing himself of his legal
right to withdraw him, indorsed the act in the following
letter addressed to his captain:&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p class='sig3'><span class='smcap'>Andover, Mass.</span>, <i>August 15, 1862</i>.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Captain Hunt</span>,&mdash;My eldest son has enlisted in your
company. I send you his younger brother. He is, and
always has been, in perfect health, of more than the ordinary
power of endurance, honest, truthful, and courageous. I
doubt not you will find him on trial all you can ask, except
his age, and that I am sorry to say is only sixteen; yet if
our country needs his service, take him.</p>
<p class='sig1'>Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Samuel Raymond</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boy went forth to real service, and to successive battles
at Kingston, at Whitehall, and at Goldsborough; and
in all this did his duty bravely and faithfully. He met the
temptations and dangers of a soldier&rsquo;s life with the pure-hearted
firmness of a Christian child, neither afraid nor
ashamed to remember his baptismal vows, his Sunday-school
teachings, and his mother&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>He had passed his promise to his mother against drinking
and smoking, and held it with a simple, childlike steadiness.
When in the midst of malarious swamps, physicians and
officers advised the use of tobacco. The boy writes to his
mother: &ldquo;A great many have begun to smoke, but I shall
not do it without your permission, though I think it does a
great deal of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his leisure hours, he was found in his tent reading;
and before battle he prepared his soul with the beautiful
psalms and collects for the day, as appointed by his church,
and writes with simplicity to his friends:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prayed God that he would watch over me, and if I
fell, receive my soul in heaven; and I also prayed that I
might not forget the cause I was fighting for, and turn my
back in fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After nine months&rsquo; service, he returned with a soldier&rsquo;s
experience, though with a frame weakened by sickness in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
malarious region. But no sooner did health and strength
return than he again enlisted, in the Massachusetts cavalry
service, and passed many months of constant activity and
adventure, being in some severe skirmishes and battles with
that portion of Sheridan&rsquo;s troops who approached nearest to
Richmond, getting within a mile and a half of the city. At
the close of this raid, so hard had been the service, that
only thirty horses were left out of seventy-four in his company,
and Walter and two others were the sole survivors
among eight who occupied the same tent.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of August, Walter was taken prisoner
in a skirmish; and from the time that this news reached
his parents, until the 18th of the following March, they
could ascertain nothing of his fate. A general exchange of
prisoners having been then effected, they learned that he
had died on Christmas Day in Salisbury Prison, of hardship
and privation.</p>
<p>What these hardships were is, alas! easy to be known
from those too well-authenticated accounts published by our
government of the treatment experienced by our soldiers in
the Rebel prisons.</p>
<p>Robbed of clothing, of money, of the soldier&rsquo;s best friend,
his sheltering blanket,&mdash;herded in shivering nakedness on
the bare ground,&mdash;deprived of every implement by which
men of energy and spirit had soon bettered their lot,&mdash;forbidden
to cut in adjacent forests branches for shelter, or fuel
to cook their coarse food,&mdash;fed on a pint of corn-and-cob-meal
per day, with some slight addition of molasses or rancid
meat,&mdash;denied all mental resources, all letters from
home, all writing to friends,&mdash;these men were cut off from
the land of the living while yet they lived,&mdash;they were
made to dwell in darkness as those that have been long
dead.</p>
<p>By such slow, lingering tortures,&mdash;such weary, wasting
anguish and sickness of body and soul,&mdash;it was the infernal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span>
policy of the Rebel government either to wring from
them an abjuration of their country, or by slow and steady
draining away of the vital forces to render them forever unfit
to serve in her armies.</p>
<p>Walter&rsquo;s constitution bore four months of this usage,
when death came to his release. A fellow sufferer, who
was with him in his last hours, brought the account to his
parents.</p>
<p>Through all his terrible privations, even the lingering
pains of slow starvation, Walter preserved his steady simplicity,
his faith in God, and unswerving fidelity to the
cause for which he was suffering.</p>
<p>When the Rebels had kept the prisoners fasting for days,
and then brought in delicacies to tempt their appetite, hoping
thereby to induce them to desert their flag, he only
answered, &ldquo;I would rather be carried out in that dead-cart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When told by some that he must steal from his fellow
sufferers, as many did, in order to relieve the pangs of hunger,
he answered, &ldquo;No, I was not brought up to that!&rdquo;
And so when his weakened system would no longer receive
the cobmeal which was his principal allowance, he set his
face calmly towards death. He grew gradually weaker and
weaker and fainter and fainter, and at last disease of the
lungs set in, and it became apparent that the end was at
hand.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, while thousands among us were bowing
in our garlanded churches or surrounding festive tables,
this young martyr lay on the cold, damp ground, watched
over by his destitute friends, who sought to soothe his last
hours with such scanty comforts as their utter poverty afforded,&mdash;raising
his head on the block of wood which was
his only pillow, and moistening his brow and lips with
water, while his life ebbed slowly away, until about two
o&rsquo;clock, when he suddenly roused himself, stretched out his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span>
hand, and, drawing to him his dearest friend among those
around him, said, in a strong, clear voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to die. Go tell my father I am ready to
die, for I die for God and my country,&rdquo;&mdash;and, looking up
with a triumphant smile, he passed to the reward of the
faithful.</p>
<p>And now, men and brethren, if this story were a single
one, it were worthy to be had in remembrance; but Walter
Raymond is not the only noble-hearted boy or man that
has been slowly tortured and starved and done to death, by
the fiendish policy of Jefferson Davis and Robert Edmund
Lee. No,&mdash;wherever this simple history shall be read,
there will arise hundreds of men and women who will testify,
&ldquo;Just so died my son!&rdquo; &ldquo;So died my brother!&rdquo;
&ldquo;So died my husband!&rdquo; &ldquo;So died my father!&rdquo; The
numbers who have died in these lingering tortures are to
be counted, not by hundreds, or even by thousands, but by
tens of thousands.</p>
<p>And is there to be no retribution for a cruelty so vast,
so aggravated, so cowardly and base? And if there is retribution,
on whose head should it fall? Shall we seize
and hang the poor, ignorant, stupid, imbruted semi-barbarians
who were set as jailers to keep these hells of torment
and inflict these insults and cruelties? or shall we punish
the educated, intelligent chiefs who were the head and brain
of the iniquity?</p>
<p>If General Lee had been determined not to have prisoners
starved or abused, does any one doubt that he could
have prevented these things? Nobody doubts it. His
raiment is red with the blood of his helpless captives. Does
any one doubt that Jefferson Davis, living in ease and luxury
in Richmond, knew that men were dying by inches in
filth and squalor and privation in the Libby Prison, within
bowshot of his own door? Nobody doubts it. It was his
will, his deliberate policy, thus to destroy those who fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
into his hands. The chief of a so-called Confederacy, who
could calmly consider among his official documents incendiary
plots for the secret destruction of ships, hotels, and
cities full of peaceable people, is a chief well worthy to preside
over such cruelties; but his only just title is President
of Assassins, and the whole civilized world should make
common cause against such a miscreant.</p>
<p>There has been, on both sides of the water, much weak,
ill-advised talk of mercy and magnanimity to be extended
to these men, whose crimes have produced a misery so vast
and incalculable. The wretches who have tortured the
weak and the helpless, who have secretly plotted to supplement,
by dastardly schemes of murder and arson, that
strength which failed them in fair fight, have been commiserated
as brave generals and unfortunate patriots, and efforts
are made to place them within the comities of war.</p>
<p>It is no feeling of personal vengeance, but a sense of the
eternal fitness of things, that makes us rejoice, when criminals
who have so outraged every sentiment of humanity
are arrested and arraigned and awarded due retribution at
the bar of their country&rsquo;s justice. There are crimes against
God and human nature which it is treason alike to God and
man not to punish; and such have been the crimes of the
traitors who were banded together in Richmond.</p>
<p>If there be those whose hearts lean to pity, we can show
them where all the pity of their hearts may be better bestowed
than in deploring the woes of assassins. Let them
think of the thousands of fathers, mothers, wives, sisters,
whose lives will be forever haunted with memories of the
slow tortures in which their best and bravest were done to
death.</p>
<p>The sufferings of those brave men are ended. Nearly a
hundred thousand are sleeping in those sad nameless graves,&mdash;and
may their rest be sweet! &ldquo;There the wicked cease
from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span>
prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
oppressor.&rdquo; But, O ye who have pity to spare, spare it
for the broken-hearted friends, who, to life&rsquo;s end, will suffer
over and over all that their dear ones endured. Pity the
mothers who hear their sons&rsquo; faint calls in dreams, who in
many a weary night-watch see them pining and wasting, and
yearn with a lifelong, unappeasable yearning to have been
able to soothe those forsaken, lonely death-beds. O man
or woman, if you have pity to spare, spend it not on Lee or
Davis,&mdash;spend it on their victims, on the thousands of
living hearts which these men of sin have doomed to an
anguish that will end only with life!</p>
<p>Blessed are the mothers whose sons passed in battle,&mdash;a
quick, a painless, a glorious death! Blessed in comparison,&mdash;yet
we weep for them. We rise up and give place at
sight of their mourning-garments. We reverence the sanctity
of their sorrow. But before this other sorrow we are
dumb in awful silence. We find no words with which to
console such grief. We feel that our peace, our liberties,
have been bought at a fearful price, when we think of the
sufferings of our martyred soldiers. Let us think of them.
It was for <i>us</i> they bore hunger and cold and nakedness.
They might have had food and raiment and comforts, if
they would have deserted our cause,&mdash;and they did not.
Cut off from all communication with home or friends or
brethren, dragging on the weary months, apparently forgotten,&mdash;still
they would not yield, they would not fight
against us; and so for us at last they died.</p>
<p>What return can we make them? Peace has come, and
we take up all our blessings restored and brightened; but
if we look, we shall see on every blessing a bloody cross.</p>
<p>When three brave men broke through the ranks of the
enemy, to bring to King David a draught from the home
well, for which he longed, the generous-hearted prince
would not drink it, but poured it out as an offering before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
the Lord; for he said, &ldquo;Is not this the blood of the men
that went in jeopardy of their lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thousands of noble hearts have been slowly consumed to
secure to us the blessings we are rejoicing in. We owe a
duty to these our martyrs,&mdash;the only one we can pay.</p>
<p>In every place, honored by such a history and example,
let a monument be raised at the public expense, on which
shall be inscribed the names of those who died for their
country, and the manner of their death. Such monuments
will educate our young men in heroic virtue, and keep alive
to future ages the flame of patriotism. And thus, too, to
the aching heart of bereaved love shall be given the only
consolation of which its sorrows admit, in the reverence
which is paid to its lost loved ones.</p>

<a name='OUR_SECOND_GIRL' id='OUR_SECOND_GIRL'></a>
<h2>OUR SECOND GIRL</h2>
</div>
<p>Our establishment on Beacon Street had been for some
days in a revolutionary state, owing to the fact that our
second girl had gone from us into the holy estate of matrimony.
Alice was a pretty, tidy, neat-handed creature, and,
like many other blessings of life, so good as to be little
appreciated while with us. It was not till she had left us
that we began to learn that clean glass, bright silver, spotless
and untumbled table-linen, and, in short, all the appetizing
arrangements and appointments of our daily meals,
were not always and in all hands matters of course.</p>
<p>In a day or two, our silver began to have the appearance
of old pewter, and our glass looked as if nothing but muddy
water could be found. On coming down to our meals, we
found the dishes in all sorts of conversational attitudes on
the table,&mdash;the meat placed diagonally, the potatoes crosswise,
and the other vegetables scattered here and there,&mdash;while
the table itself stood rakishly aslant, and wore the
air of a table slightly intoxicated.</p>
<p>Our beautiful china, moreover, began to have little
chipped places in the edges, most unusual and distressing
to our eyes; the handles vanished from our teacups, and
here and there a small mouthful appeared to be bitten out
of the nose of some pretty fancy pitchers, which had been
the delight of my eyes.</p>
<p>Now, if there is anything which I specially affect, it is a
refined and pretty table arrangement, and at our house for
years and years such had prevailed. All of us had rather
a weakness for china, and the attractions of the fragile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
world, as presented in the great crockery-stores, had been
many times too much for our prudence and purse. Consequently
we had all sorts of little domestic idols of the
breakfast and dinner table,&mdash;Bohemian-glass drinking-mugs
of antique shape, lovely bits of biscuit choicely moulded
in classic patterns, beauties, oddities, and quaintnesses in
the way of especial teacups and saucers, devoted to different
members of the family, wherein each took a particular and
individual delight. Our especial china or glass pets of the
table often started interesting conversations on the state of
the plastic arts as applied to every-day life, and the charm
of being encircled, even in the material act of feeding our
mortal bodies, with a sort of halo of art and beauty.</p>
<p>All this time none of us ever thought in how great degree
our feeling for elegance and refinement owed its gratification
at the hour of meals to the care, the tidiness, and
neat handling of our now lost and wedded Alice.</p>
<p>Nothing presents so forlorn an appearance as battered
and neglected finery of any kind; and elegant pitchers with
their noses knocked off, cut glass with cracked edges, and
fragments of artistic teacups and saucers on a tumbled tablecloth,
have a peculiarly dismal appearance. In fact, we
had really occasion to wonder at the perfectly weird and
bewitched effect which one of our two Hibernian successors
to the pretty Alice succeeded in establishing in our table
department. Every caprice in the use and employment of
dishes, short of serving cream in the gravy-boats and using
the sugar-bowl for pickled oysters and the cream-pitcher for
vinegar, seemed possible and permissible. My horror was
completed one morning on finding a china hen, artistically
represented as brooding on a nest, made to cover, not boiled
eggs, but a lot of greasy hash, over which she sat so that
her head and tail bewilderingly projected beyond the sides
of the nest, instead of keeping lengthwise within it, as a
respectable hen in her senses might be expected to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_451' name='page_451'></a>451</span>
There certainly is a great amount of native vigor shown by
these untrained Hibernians in always finding an unexpected
wrong way of doing the simplest thing. It quite enlarges
one&rsquo;s ideas of human possibilities.</p>
<p>In a paroxysm of vexation, I reviled matrimony and
Murphy O&rsquo;Connor, who had stolen our household treasure,
and further expressed my griefs, as elder sons are apt to do,
by earnest expostulations with the maternal officer on the
discouraging state of things; declaring most earnestly, morning,
noon, and night, that all was going to ruin, that everything
was being spoiled, that nothing was even decent, and
that, if things went on so much longer, I should be obliged
to go out and board,&mdash;by which style of remark I nearly
drove that long-suffering woman frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be reasonable, Tom,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Can I make girls
to order? Can I do anything more than try such as apply,
when they seem to give promise of success? Delicacy of
hand, neatness, nicety of eye, are not things likely to be
cultivated in the Irish boarding-houses from which our candidates
emerge. What chance have the most of them had
to learn anything except the most ordinary rough housework?
A trained girl is rare as a nugget of gold amid the
sands of the washings; but let us persevere in trying, and
one will come at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope, at any rate, you have sent off that Bridget,&rdquo;
I said, in high disdain. &ldquo;I verily believe, if that girl stays
a week longer, I shall have to leave the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compose yourself,&rdquo; said my mother; &ldquo;Bridget&rsquo;s bundle
is made up, and she is going. I&rsquo;m sorry for her too, poor
thing; for she seemed anxious to keep the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the doorbell rang. &ldquo;I presume that&rsquo;s
the new girl whom they have sent round for me to see,&rdquo; said
my mother.</p>
<p>I opened the door, and there in fact stood a girl dressed
in a neat-fitting dark calico, with a straw bonnet, simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_452' name='page_452'></a>452</span>
tied with some dark ribbon, and a veil which concealed her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Seymour at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told that she wanted a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does; will you walk in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pique myself somewhat on the power of judging character,
and there was something about this applicant which
inspired hope; so that, before I introduced her into the
room, I felt it necessary to enlighten my mother with a
little of my wisdom. I therefore whispered in her ear,
with the decisive tone of an eldest son, &ldquo;I think, mother,
this one will do; you had better engage her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lived out much?&rdquo; said my mother, commencing
the usual inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not, ma&rsquo;am. I am but lately come to the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; I am American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been accustomed to the care of the table,&mdash;silver,
glass, and china?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, ma&rsquo;am, I understand what is necessary for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this while the speaker remained standing with her
veil down; her answers seemed to be the briefest possible;
and yet, notwithstanding the homely plainness of her dress,
there was something about her that impressed both my
mother and me with an idea of cultivation and refinement
above her apparent station,&mdash;there was a composure and
quiet decision in her manner of speaking which produced
the same impression on us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wages do you expect?&rdquo; said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you have been accustomed to give to a girl
in that place will satisfy me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing I would like to ask,&rdquo; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_453' name='page_453'></a>453</span>
added, with a slight hesitation and embarrassment of manner;
&ldquo;would it be convenient for me to have a room by
myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded to my mother to answer in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The three girls who composed our establishment had
usually roomed in one large apartment, but there was a
small closet of a room which I had taken for books, fishing-rods,
guns, and any miscellaneous property of my own. I
mentally turned these out, and devoted the room to the
newcomer, whose appearance interested me.</p>
<p>And, as my mother hesitated, I remarked, with the assured
tone of master of the house, that &ldquo;certainly she could
have a small room to herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all I ask,&rdquo; she briefly answered. &ldquo;In that case,
I will come for the same wages you paid the last girl in my
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you come?&rdquo; said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to come immediately. I only want time to
go and order my things to be sent here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and left us, saying that we might expect her
that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;you seem to have taken
it upon you to settle this matter on your own authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear little mother,&rdquo; said I, in a patronizing tone,
&ldquo;I have an instinctive certainty that she will do. I wanted
to make sure of a prize for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the single room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; I&rsquo;ll move all my traps out of the little
third-story room. It&rsquo;s my belief that this girl or woman
has seen better days; and if she has, a room to herself will
be a necessity of her case,&mdash;poor thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said my mother hesitatingly. &ldquo;I never
wish to employ in my service those above their station,&mdash;they
always make trouble; and there is something in this
woman&rsquo;s air and manner and pronunciation that makes me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_454' name='page_454'></a>454</span>
feel as if she had been born and bred in cultivated society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing she has,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite evident that
she, for some reason, means to conform to this position.
You seldom have a girl apply for work who comes dressed
with such severe simplicity; her manner is retiring, and
she seemed perfectly willing and desirous to undertake any
of the things which you mentioned as among her daily
tasks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the afternoon of that day our new assistant came, and
my mother was delighted with the way she set herself at
work. The china-closet, desecrated and disordered in the
preceding reigns of terror and confusion, immediately underwent
a most quiet but thorough transformation. Everything
was cleaned, brightened, and arranged with a system
and thoroughness which showed, as my mother remarked, a
good head; and all this was done so silently and quietly that
it seemed like magic. By the time we came down to breakfast
the next morning, we perceived that the reforms of our
new prime minister had extended everywhere. The dining-room
was clean, cool, thoroughly dusted, and freshly aired;
the tablecloth and napkins were smooth and clean; the
glass glittered like crystal, and the silver wore a cheerful
brightness. Added to this were some extra touches of
refinement, which I should call table coquetry. The cold
meat was laid out with green fringes of parsley; and a
bunch of heliotrope, lemon verbena, and mignonette, with a
fresh rosebud, all culled from our little back yard, stood in
a wineglass on my mother&rsquo;s waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mary, you have done wonders,&rdquo; said my mother,
as she took her place; &ldquo;your arrangements restore appetite
to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary received our praises with a gracious smile, yet
with a composed gravity which somewhat puzzled me. She
seemed perfectly obliging and amiable, yet there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_455' name='page_455'></a>455</span>
serious reticence about her that quite piqued my curiosity.
I could not help recurring to the idea of a lady in disguise;
though I scarcely knew to what circumstance about her I
could attach the idea. So far from the least effort to play
the lady, her dress was, in homely plainness, a perfect contrast
to that of the girls who had preceded her. It consisted
of strong dark-blue stuff, made perfectly plain to her figure,
with a narrow band of white linen around her throat. Her
dark brown hair was brushed smoothly away from her face,
and confined simply behind in a net; there was not the
slightest pretension to coquetry in its arrangement; in fact,
the object seemed to be to get it snugly out of the way,
rather than to make it a matter of ornament. Nevertheless,
I could not help remarking that there was a good deal of it,
and that it waved very prettily, notwithstanding the care
that had been taken to brush the curl out of it.</p>
<p>She was apparently about twenty years of age. Her face
was not handsome, but it was a refined and intelligent one.
The skin had a sallow hue, which told of ill health or of
misfortune; there were lines of trouble about the eye; but
the mouth and chin had that unmistakable look of firmness
which speaks a person able and resolved to do a quiet
battle with adverse fate, and to go through to the end
with whatever is needed to be done, without fretfulness and
without complaint. She had large, cool, gray eyes, attentive
and thoughtful, and she met the look of any one who
addressed her with an honest firmness; she seemed to be, in
fact, simply and only interested to know and to do the work
she had undertaken,&mdash;but what there might be behind and
beyond that I could not conjecture.</p>
<p>One thing about her dress most in contrast with that of
the other servants was that she evidently wore no crinoline.
The exuberance of this article in the toilet of our domestics
had become threatening of late, apparently requiring that
the kitchens and pantries should be torn down and rebuilt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_456' name='page_456'></a>456</span>
As matters were, our three girls never could be in our kitchen
at one time without reefings and man&oelig;uvrings of their
apparel which much impeded any other labor, and caused
some loss of temper; and our china-closet was altogether
too small for the officials who had to wash the china there,
and they were constantly at odds with my mother for her
firmness in resisting their tendency to carry our china and
silver to the general mélée of the kitchen sink. Moreover,
our dining-room not having been constructed with an eye to
modern expansions of the female toilet, it happened that,
if our table was to be enlarged for guests, there arose serious
questions of the waiter&rsquo;s crinoline to complicate the calculations;
and for all these reasons, I was inclined to look
with increasing wonder on a being in female form who could
so far defy the tyranny of custom as to dress in a convenient
and comfortable manner, adapted to the work which she
undertook to perform. A good-looking girl without crinoline
had a sort of unworldly freshness of air that really constituted
a charm. If it had been a piece of refined coquetry,&mdash;as
certainly it was not,&mdash;it could not have been better
planned.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more perfectly proper than the demeanor
of this girl in relation to all the proprieties of her
position. She seemed to give her whole mind to it with an
anxious exactness; but she appeared to desire no relations
with the family other than those of a mere business character.
It was impossible to draw her into conversation. If
a good-natured remark was addressed to her on any subject
such as in kindly disposed families is often extended as an
invitation to a servant to talk a little with an employer,
Mary met it with the briefest and gravest response that was
compatible with propriety, and with a definite and marked
respectfulness of demeanor which had precisely the effect of
throwing us all at a distance, like ceremonious politeness in
the intercourse of good society.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_457' name='page_457'></a>457</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot make out our Mary,&rdquo; said I to my mother;
&ldquo;she is a perfect treasure, but who or what do you suppose
she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;All I know is,
she understands her business perfectly, and does it exactly;
but she no more belongs to the class of common servants
than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she associate with the other girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;except at meal-times, and when about her
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would provoke the pride of sweet
Erin,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think so,&rdquo; said my mother; &ldquo;but she certainly
has managed her relations with them with a curious
kind of tact. She always treats them with perfect consideration
and politeness, talks with them during the times
that they necessarily are thrown together in the most affable
and cheerful manner, and never assumes any airs of supremacy
with them. Her wanting a room to herself gave them
at first an idea that she would hold herself aloof from them,
and in fact, for the first few days, there was a subterranean
fire in the kitchen ready to burst forth; but now all that is
past, and in some way or other, without being in the least
like any of them, she has contrived to make them her fast
friends. I found her last night in the kitchen writing a
letter for the cook, and the other day she was sitting in her
room trimming a bonnet for Katy; and her opinion seems
to be law in the kitchen. She seldom sits there, and spends
most of her leisure in her own room, which is as tidy as a
bee&rsquo;s cell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading, sewing, and writing, as far as I can see.
There are a few books, and a portfolio, and a small inkstand
there,&mdash;and a neat little work-basket. She is very nice
with her needle, and obliging in putting her talents to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_458' name='page_458'></a>458</span>
service of the other girls; but towards me she is the most
perfectly silent and reserved being that one can conceive.
I can&rsquo;t make conversation with her; she keeps me off by a
most rigid respectfulness of demeanor which seems to say
that she wants nothing from me but my orders. I feel
that I could no more ask her a question about her private
affairs, than I could ask one of Mrs. McGregor in the next
street. But then it is a comfort to have some one so entirely
trustworthy as she is in charge of all the nice little
articles which require attention and delicate handling. She
is the only girl I ever had whom I could trust to arrange a
parlor and a table without any looking after. Her eye and
hand, and her ideas, are certainly those of a lady, whatever
her position may have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time our Mary became quite a family institution for
us, seeming to fill a thousand little places in the domestic
arrangement where a hand or an eye was needed. She was
deft at mending glass and china, and equally so at mending
all sorts of household things. She darned the napkins and
tablecloths in a way that excited my mother&rsquo;s admiration,
and was always so obliging and ready to offer her services
that, in time, a resort to Mary&rsquo;s work-basket and ever ready
needle became the most natural thing in the world to all of
us. She seemed to have no acquaintance in the city, never
went out visiting, received no letters,&mdash;in short, seemed
to live a completely isolated life, and to dwell in her own
thoughts in her own solitary little room.</p>
<p>By that talent for systematic arrangement which she possessed,
she secured for herself a good many hours to spend
there. My mother, seeing her taste for reading, offered her
the use of our books; and one volume after another spent
its quiet week or fortnight in her room, and returned to our
shelves in due time. They were mostly works of solid
information,&mdash;history, travels,&mdash;and a geography and
atlas which had formed part of the school outfit of one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_459' name='page_459'></a>459</span>
the younger children she seemed interested to retain for
some time. &ldquo;It is my opinion,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;that she
is studying,&mdash;perhaps with a view to getting some better
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray keep her with us,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you can. Why
don&rsquo;t you raise her wages? You know that she does more
than any other girl ever did before in her place, and is so
trustworthy that she is invaluable to us. Persons of her
class are worth higher wages than common uneducated
servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother accordingly did make a handsome addition to
Mary&rsquo;s wages, and by the time she had been with us a year
the confidence which her quiet manner had inspired was
such that, if my mother wished to be gone for a day or
two, the house, with all that was in it, was left trustingly
in Mary&rsquo;s hands, as with a sort of housekeeper. She was
charged with all the last directions, as well as the keys to
the jellies, cakes, and preserves, with discretionary power
as to their use; and yet, for some reason, such was the
ascendency she contrived to keep over her Hibernian friends
in the kitchen, all this confidence evidently seemed to them
quite as proper as to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t quite like us,&rdquo; said Biddy one day, mysteriously,
as she looked after her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s seen better days, or
I&rsquo;m mistaken; but she don&rsquo;t take airs on her. She knows
how to take the bad luck quiet like, and do the best she
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she ever told you anything of herself, Biddy?&rdquo;
said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? No. It&rsquo;s a quiet tongue she keeps in her head.
She is ready enough to do good turns for us, and to smooth
out our ways, and hear our stories, but it&rsquo;s close in her own
affairs she is. Maybe she don&rsquo;t like to be talkin&rsquo;, when
talkin&rsquo; does no good,&mdash;poor soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters thus went on, and I amused myself now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_460' name='page_460'></a>460</span>
then with speculating about Mary. I would sometimes go
to her to ask some of those little charities of the needle
which our sex are always needing from feminine hands;
but never, in the course of any of these little transactions,
could I establish the slightest degree of confidential communication.
If she sewed on a shirt-button, she did it with as
abstracted an air as if my arm were a post which she was
required to handle, and not the arm of a good-looking youth
of twenty-five,&mdash;as I fondly hoped I was. And certain
remarks which I once addressed to her in regard to her
studies and reading in her own apartment were met with
that cool, wide-open gaze of her calm gray eyes, that seemed
to say, &ldquo;Pray, what is that to your purpose, sir?&rdquo; and
she merely answered, &ldquo;Is there anything else that you
would like me to do, sir?&rdquo; with a marked deference that
was really defiant.</p>
<p>But one day I fancied I had got hold of a clue. I
was standing in our lower front hall, when I saw young
McPherson, whom I used to know in New York, coming
up the doorsteps.</p>
<p>At the moment that he rung the doorbell, our Mary,
who had seen him from the chamber window, suddenly
grew pale, and said to my mother, &ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, will
you be so good as to excuse my going to the door? I feel
faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother spoke over the banisters, and I opened the
door, and let in McPherson.</p>
<p>He and I were jolly together, as old classmates are wont
to be, and orders were given to lay a plate for him at
dinner.</p>
<p>Mary prepared the service with her usual skill and care,
but pleaded that her illness increased so that it would be
impossible for her to wait on table. Now, nobody in the
house thought there was anything peculiar about this but
myself. My mother, indeed, had noticed that Mary&rsquo;s faintness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_461' name='page_461'></a>461</span>
had come on very suddenly, as she looked out on the
street; but it was I who suggested to her that McPherson
might have some connection with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, mother, he is somebody whom she has
known in her former life, and doesn&rsquo;t wish to meet,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Tom; you are always getting up mysteries,
and fancying romances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I took a vicious pleasure in experimenting
on the subject; and therefore, a day or two after, when I
had got Mary fairly within eye-range, as she waited on
table, I remarked to my mother carelessly, &ldquo;By the bye, the
McPhersons are coming to Boston to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary jerk of Mary&rsquo;s hand, as she was
filling a tumbler, and then I could see the restraint of self-command
passing all over her. I had hit something, I
knew; so I pursued my game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;Jim is here to look at houses; he
is thinking strongly of one in the next block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a look of repressed fear and distress on Mary&rsquo;s
face as she hastily turned away, and made an errand into
the china-closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found a clue,&rdquo; I said to my mother triumphantly,
going to her room after dinner. &ldquo;Did you notice
Mary&rsquo;s agitation when I spoke of the McPhersons coming
to Boston? By Jove! but the girl is plucky, though; it
was the least little start, and in a minute she had her
visor down and her armor buckled. This certainly becomes
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, I certainly must ask you what business it is of
yours,&rdquo; said my mother, settling back into the hortatory
attitude familiar to mothers. &ldquo;Supposing the thing is as
you think,&mdash;suppose that Mary is a girl of refinement
and education, who, from some unfortunate reason, has no
resource but her present position,&mdash;why should you hunt
her out of it? If she is, as you think, a lady, there is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_462' name='page_462'></a>462</span>
strongest reason why a gentleman should respect her feelings.
I fear the result of all this restless prying and intermeddling
of yours will be to drive her away; and really,
now I have had her, I don&rsquo;t know how I ever could do
without her. People talk of female curiosity,&rdquo; said my
mother, with a slightly belligerent air; &ldquo;I never found but
men had fully as much curiosity as women. Now, what
will become of us all if your restlessness about this should
be the means of Mary&rsquo;s leaving us? You know the perfectly
dreadful times we had before she came, and I don&rsquo;t
know anybody who has less patience to bear such things
than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, my mother was in that positive state of mind
which is expressed by the colloquial phrase of being on
her high horse. I&mdash;as the male part of creation always
must in such cases&mdash;became very meek and retiring, and
promised to close my eyes and ears, and not dream, or
think, or want to know, anything which it was not agreeable
to Mary and my mother that I should. I would not look
towards the doorbell, nor utter a word about the McPhersons,
who, by the bye, decided to take the house in our
neighborhood.</p>
<p>But though I was as exemplary as one of the saints,
it did no good. Mary, for some reasons known to herself,
became fidgety, nervous, restless, and had frequent headaches
and long crying spells in her own private apartment,
after the manner of women when something is the matter
with them.</p>
<p>My mother was, as she always is with every creature in
her employ, maternal and sympathetic, and tried her very
best to get into her confidence.</p>
<p>Mary only confessed to feeling a little unwell, and hinted
obscurely that perhaps she should be obliged to leave the
place. But it was quite evident that her leaving was connected
with the near advent of the McPhersons in the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_463' name='page_463'></a>463</span>
block; for I observed that she always showed some little
irrepressible signs of nervousness whenever that subject
was incidentally alluded to. Finally, on the day that their
furniture began to arrive, and to provide abundant material
for gossip and comment to the other members of the kitchen
cabinet, Mary&rsquo;s mind appeared suddenly made up. She
came into my mother&rsquo;s room looking as a certain sort of
women do when they have made a resolution which they
mean to stand by,&mdash;very pale, very quiet, and very decided.
She asked to see my mother alone, and in that interview
she simply expressed gratitude for all her kindness to her,
but said that circumstances would oblige her to go to New
York.</p>
<p>My mother now tried her best to draw from her her history,
whatever that might be. She spoke with tact and tenderness,
and with the respect due from one human being to
another; for my mother always held that every soul has its
own inviolable private door which it has a right to keep
closed, and at which even queens and duchesses, if they
wish to enter, must knock humbly and reverently.</p>
<p>Mary was almost overcome by her kindness. She thanked
her over and over; at times my mother said she looked at
her wistfully, as if on the very point of speaking, and then,
quietly gathering herself within herself, she remained silent.
All that could be got from her was, that it was necessary
for her hereafter to live in New York.</p>
<p>The servants in the kitchen, with the warm-heartedness
of their race, broke out into a perfect Irish howl of sorrow;
and at the last moment, Biddy, our fat cook, fell on her
neck and lifted up her voice and wept, almost smothering
her with her tumultuous embraces; and the whole party of
them would go with her to the New York station, one carrying
her shawl, another her hand-bag and parasol, with
emulous affection; and so our very pleasant and desirable
second girl disappeared, and we saw her no more.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_464' name='page_464'></a>464</span></div>
<p>Six months after this, when our Mary had become only
a memory of the past, I went to spend a week or two in
Newport, and took, among other matters and things, a letter
of introduction to Mrs. McIntyre, a Scotch lady, who
had just bought a pretty cottage there, and, as my friend
who gave it told me, would prove an interesting acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a pretty niece,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who I&rsquo;m told is
heiress to her property, and is called a very nice girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, at the proper time, I lounged in one morning, and
found a very charming, cosy, home-like parlor, arranged
with all those little refined touches and artistic effects by
which people of certain tastes and habits at once recognize
each other in all parts of the world, as by the tokens of
freemasonry. I felt perfectly acquainted with Mrs. McIntyre
from the first glance at her parlor,&mdash;where the books,
the music, the birds, the flowers, and that everlasting variety
of female small-work prepared me for a bright, chatty,
easy-going, home-loving kind of body, such as I found Mrs.
McIntyre to be. She was, as English and Scotch ladies are
apt to be, very oddly dressed in very nice and choice articles.
It takes the eye of the connoisseur to appreciate these
oddly dressed Englishwomen. They are like antique china;
but a discriminating eye soon sees the real quality that underlies
their quaint adornment. Mrs. McIntyre was scrupulously,
exquisitely neat. All her articles of dress were of
the choicest quality. The yellow and tumbled lace that was
fussed about her neck and wrists might have been the heirloom
of a countess; her satin gown, though very short and
very scanty, was of a fabulous richness; and the rings that
glittered on her withered hands were of the fashion of two
centuries ago, but of wonderful brilliancy.</p>
<p>She was very gracious in her reception, as my letter was
from an old friend, and said many obliging things of me;
so I was taken at once to her friendship, with the frankness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_465' name='page_465'></a>465</span>
characteristic of people of her class when they make up their
minds to know you at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must introduce you to my Mary,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;she
has just gone into the garden to cut flowers for the vases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment more &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; entered the room, with a
little white apron full of flowers, and a fresh bloom on her
cheeks; and I was&mdash;as the reader has already anticipated&mdash;to
my undisguised amazement, formally introduced to
Miss Mary McIntyre, our second girl.</p>
<p>Of all things for which I consider women admirable, there
is no trait which fills me with such positive awe as their
social tact and self-command. Evidently this meeting was
quite as unexpected to Mary as to me; but except for a
sudden flash of amused astonishment in the eyes, and a becoming
flush of complexion, she met me as any thoroughbred
young lady meets a young man properly presented by
her maternal guardian.</p>
<p>For my part, I had one of those dreamy periods of existence
in which people doubt whether they are awake or
asleep. The world seemed all turning topsy-turvy. I was
filled with curiosity, which I could with difficulty keep
within the limits of conventional propriety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Mr. Seymour, that you are very much astonished,&rdquo;
said Mary to me, when Mrs. McIntyre had left the
room to give some directions to the servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I never was more so; I feel
as if I were in the midst of a fairy tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing so remarkable as that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But since
I saw you, a happy change, as I need not tell you now, has
come over my life through the coming of my mother&rsquo;s sister
to America. When my mother died, my aunt was in India.
The letters that I addressed to her in Scotland were a long
time in reaching her, and then it took a long time for her
to wind up her affairs there, and find her way to this country.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_466' name='page_466'></a>466</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what could&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could induce me to do as I did? Well, I knew
your mother&rsquo;s character,&mdash;no matter how. I needed a
support and protection, and I resolved for a time to put myself
under her wing. I knew that in case of any real trouble
I should find in her a true friend and a safe adviser, and
I hoped to earn her esteem and confidence by steadily doing
my duty. Some other time, perhaps, I will tell you more,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>The return of Mrs. McIntyre put an end to our private
communication, but she insisted, with true old-world hospitality,
on my remaining to dinner.</p>
<p>Here I was precipitated into a romance at once. Mary
had just enough of that perverse feminine pleasure in teasing
to keep my interest alive. The fact was, she saw me
becoming entangled from day to day without any more misgivings
of conscience than the celebrated spider of the poem
felt when she invited the fly to walk into her parlor.</p>
<p>Mrs. McIntyre took me in a very marked way into her
good graces, and I had every opportunity to ride, walk,
sketch, and otherwise to attend upon Mary; and Mary was
gracious also, but so quietly and discreetly mistress of herself
that I could not for the life of me tell what to make of
her. There were all sorts of wonders and surmises boiling
up within me. What was it about McPherson? Was there
anything there? Was Mary engaged? Or was there any
old affair? etc., etc. Not that it was any business of mine;
but then a fellow likes to know his ground before&mdash;Before
<i>what</i>? I thought to myself, and that unknown <span class='smcaplc'>WHAT</span>
every day assumed new importance in my eyes. Mary had
many admirers. Her quiet, easy, self-possessed manners,
her perfect tact and grace, always made her a favorite; but
I could not help hoping that between her and me there was
that confidential sense of a mutually kept secret which it is
delightful to share with the woman you wish to please.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_467' name='page_467'></a>467</span></div>
<p>Why won&rsquo;t women sometimes enlighten a fellow a little
in this dark valley that lies between intimate acquaintance
and the awful final proposal? To be sure, there are kind
souls who will come more than halfway to meet you, but
they are always sure to be those you don&rsquo;t want to meet.
The woman you want is always as reticent as a nut, and
leaves you the whole work of this last dread scene without
a bit of help on her part. To be sure, she smiles on you;
but what of that? You see she smiles also on Tom, Dick,
and Harry.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike;<br />
And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>I fought out a battle of two or three weeks with my fair
foe, trying to get in advance some hint from her as to what
she would do with me if I put myself at her mercy. No
use. Our sex may as well give up first as last before one
of these quiet, resolved, little pieces of femininity, who are
perfect mistresses of all the peculiar weapons, defensive and
offensive, of womanhood. There was nothing for it but to
surrender at discretion; but when I had done this, I was
granted all the honors of war. Mrs. McIntyre received me
with an old-fashioned maternal blessing, and all was as
happy as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;I suppose, sir, you will claim
a right to know all about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; I said complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you have been dying of curiosity ever since I
was waiting behind your lordship&rsquo;s chair at your mother&rsquo;s.
I knew you suspected something then,&mdash;confess now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could have led you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hear. My mother, who was Mrs. McIntyre&rsquo;s sister,
had by a first marriage only myself. Shortly after my
father&rsquo;s death, she married a widower with several children.
As long as she lived, I never knew what want or care or
trouble was; but just as I was entering upon my seventeenth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_468' name='page_468'></a>468</span>
year she died. A year after her death, my stepfather, who
was one of those men devoted to matrimony at all hazards,
married another woman, by whom he had children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few years more, he died; and his affairs, on examination,
proved to be in a very bad state; there was, in fact,
scarcely anything for us to live on. Our stepmother had a
settlement from her brother. The two other daughters of
my father were married, and went to houses of their own;
and I was left, related really to nobody, without property
and without home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose hundreds of young girls are from one reason
or other left just in this way, and have, without any previous
preparation in their education and habits, to face the
question, How can I get a living?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you it is a serious question for a young girl
who has grown up in the easy manner in which I had. My
stepfather had always been a cheery, kindly, generous man,
one of those who love to see people enjoy themselves, and
to have things done handsomely, and had kept house in a
free, abundant, hospitable manner; so that when I came to
look myself over in relation to the great uses of life, I could
make out very little besides expensive tastes and careless
habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been to the very best schools, but then I had
studied, as most girls in easy circumstances do, without a
thought of using my knowledge for any practical purpose.
I could speak very fair English; but how I did it, or why,
I didn&rsquo;t know,&mdash;all the technical rules of grammar had
passed from my head like a dream. I could play a little on
the piano, and sing a few songs; but I did not know enough
of music to venture to propose myself as a teacher; and so
with every other study. All the situations of profit in the
profession of teaching are now crowded and blocked by girls
who have been studying for that express object,&mdash;and what
could I hope among them?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_469' name='page_469'></a>469</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My mother-in-law was a smart, enterprising, driving
woman of the world, who told all her acquaintance that, of
course, she should give me a home, although I was no kind
of relation to her, and who gave me to understand that I
was under infinite obligations to her on this account, and
must pay for the privilege by making myself generally useful.
I soon found that this meant doing a servant&rsquo;s work
without wages. During six months I filled, I may say, the
place of a seamstress and nursery governess to some very
ungoverned children, varying with occasional weeks of servant&rsquo;s
work, when either the table girl or the cook left a
place vacant. For all this I received my board, and some
cast-off dresses and underclothes to make over for myself.
I was tired of this, and begged my stepmother to find me
some place where I could earn my own living. She was
astonished and indignant at the demand. When Providence
had provided me a good home, under respectable protection,
she said, why should I ask to leave it? For her part, she
thought the situation of a young lady making herself generally
useful in domestic life, in the family of her near connections,
was a delightful one. She had no words to say
how much more respectable and proper it was thus to live
in the circle of family usefulness and protection, than to go
out in the world looking for employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not suggest to her that the chief difference in the
cases would be, that in a hired situation I should have regular
wages and regular work; whereas in my present position
it was irregular work, and no wages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her views on the subject were perhaps somewhat beclouded
by the extreme convenience she found in being able
to go into company, and to range about the city at all hours,
unembarrassed by those family cares which generally fall to
the mistress, but which her views of what constituted general
usefulness devolved upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no retirement, no leisure, no fixed place anywhere.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_470' name='page_470'></a>470</span>
My bed was in the nursery, where the children felt always
free to come and go; and even this I was occasionally requested
to resign, to share the couch of the housemaid, when
sickness in the family or a surplus of guests caused us to be
crowded for room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew very unhappy, my health failed, and the demands
upon me were entirely beyond my strength, and without any
consideration. The doer of all the odds and ends in a family
has altogether the most work and least praise of any, as
I discovered to my cost. I found one thing after another
falling into my long list of appointed duties, by a regular
progress. Thus first it would be, &lsquo;Mary, won&rsquo;t you see to
the dusting of the parlors? for Bridget is&rsquo;&mdash;etc., etc.; this
would be the form for a week or two, and then, &lsquo;Mary, have
you dusted the parlors?&rsquo; and at last, &lsquo;Mary, why have you
not dusted the parlors?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said, I never studied anything to practical advantage;
and though I had been through arithmetic and algebra,
I had never made any particular use of my knowledge. But
now, under the influence of misfortune, my thoughts took
an arithmetical turn. By inquiring among the servants, I
found that, in different families in the neighborhood, girls
were receiving three dollars a week for rendering just such
services as mine. Here was a sum of a hundred and fifty-six
dollars yearly, in ready money, put into their hands,
besides their board, the privilege of knowing their work
exactly, and having a control of their own time when certain
definite duties were performed. Compared with what
I was doing and receiving, this was riches and ease and
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I thought to myself, why should not I find
some respectable, superior, motherly woman, and put myself
under her as a servant, make her my friend by good conduct,
and have some regular hours and some definite income,
instead of wearing out my life in service without pay?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_471' name='page_471'></a>471</span>
Nothing stood in my way but the traditionary shadow of
gentility, and I resolved it should not stop me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years before, when I was only eight or ten years old,
I had met your mother with your family at the seaside,
where my mother took me. I had seen a great deal of her,
and knew all about her. I remembered well her habitual
consideration for the nurses and servants in her employ. I
knew her address in Boston, and I resolved to try to find a
refuge in her family. And so there is my story. I left a
note with my stepmother, saying that I was going to seek
independent employment, and then went to Boston to your
house. There I hoped to find a quiet asylum,&mdash;at least,
till I could hear from my aunt in Scotland. The delay of
hearing from her during those two years at your house often
made me low-spirited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what made you so afraid of McPherson?&rdquo; said I
nervously. &ldquo;I remember your faintness, and all that, the
day he called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that? Why, it was merely this,&mdash;they were on
intimate visiting terms with my mother-in-law, and I knew
that it would be all up with my plans if they were to be
often at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell my mother?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think of it, but then&rdquo;&mdash;She gave me a curious
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I could see plainly enough that there were no
secrets between you and her, and I did not wish to take so
fine a young gentleman into my confidence,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;You will observe I was not out seeking flirtations, but an
honest independence.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>My mother was apprised of our engagement in due form,
and came to Newport, all innocence, to call on Miss McIntyre,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_472' name='page_472'></a>472</span>
her intended daughter-in-law. Her astonishment at the moment
of introduction was quite satisfactory to me.</p>
<p>For the rest, Mary&rsquo;s talents in making a home agreeable
have had since then many years of proof; and where any
of the little domestic chasms appear which are formed by
the shifting nature of the American working-class, she always
slides into the place with a quiet grace, and reminds
me, with a humorous twinkle of the eye, that she is used
to being second girl.</p>

<h2>A SCHOLAR&rsquo;S ADVENTURES IN THE COUNTRY</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only live in the country,&rdquo; said my wife,
&ldquo;how much easier it would be to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much cheaper!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have a little place of our own, and raise our own
things!&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;Dear me! I am heartsick when I
think of the old place at home, and father&rsquo;s great garden.
What peaches and melons we used to have! what green
peas and corn! Now one has to buy every cent&rsquo;s worth of
these things&mdash;and how they taste! Such wilted, miserable
corn! Such peas! Then, if we lived in the country,
we should have our own cow, and milk and cream in abundance;
our own hens and chickens. We could have custard
and ice-cream every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of the trees and flowers, and all that,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>The result of this little domestic duet was that my wife
and I began to ride about the city of &mdash;&mdash; to look up some
pretty, interesting cottage, where our visions of rural bliss
might be realized. Country residences, near the city, we
found to bear rather a high price; so that it was no easy
matter to find a situation suitable to the length of our purse;
till, at last, a judicious friend suggested a happy expedient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow a few hundred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and give your note;
you can save enough, very soon, to make the difference.
When you raise everything you eat, you know it will make
your salary go a wonderful deal further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it will,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And what can be more
beautiful than to buy places by the simple process of giving
one&rsquo;s note?&mdash;&rsquo;tis so neat, and handy, and convenient!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_474' name='page_474'></a>474</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; pursued my friend, &ldquo;there is Mr. B., my next-door
neighbor&mdash;&rsquo;tis enough to make one sick of life in the
city to spend a week out on his farm. Such princely living
as one gets! And he assures me that it costs him very
little&mdash;scarce anything perceptible, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;few people can say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;he has a couple of peach-trees
for every month, from June till frost, that furnish as many
peaches as he, and his wife, and ten children can dispose of.
And then he has grapes, apricots, etc.; and last year his
wife sold fifty dollars&rsquo; worth from her strawberry patch, and
had an abundance for the table besides. Out of the milk of
only one cow they had butter enough to sell three or four
pounds a week, besides abundance of milk and cream; and
madam has the butter for her pocket money. This is the
way country people manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; thought I. And my wife and I could
scarcely sleep, all night, for the brilliancy of our anticipations!</p>
<p>To be sure our delight was somewhat damped the next
day by the coldness with which my good old uncle, Jeremiah
Standfast, who happened along at precisely this crisis,
listened to our visions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it pleasant, children, in the summer time,&rdquo;
said the hard-fisted old man, twirling his blue-checked
pocket-handkerchief; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve gone in debt
for the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we shall soon save that&mdash;it&rsquo;s so much cheaper
living in the country!&rdquo; said both of us together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that, I don&rsquo;t think it is, to city-bred folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I broke in with a flood of accounts of Mr. B.&rsquo;s
peach-trees, and Mrs. B.&rsquo;s strawberries, butter, apricots, etc.,
etc.; to which the old gentleman listened with such a long,
leathery, unmoved quietude of visage as quite provoked me,
and gave me the worst possible opinion of his judgment. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_475' name='page_475'></a>475</span>
was disappointed, too; for as he was reckoned one of the
best practical farmers in the county, I had counted on an
enthusiastic sympathy with all my agricultural designs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a body can live in
the country, as you say, amazin&rsquo; cheap; but then a body
must <i>know how</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and my uncle spread his pocket-handkerchief
thoughtfully out upon his knees, and shook his
head gravely.</p>
<p>I thought him a terribly slow, stupid old body, and wondered
how I had always entertained so high an opinion of
his sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is evidently getting old,&rdquo; said I to my wife; &ldquo;his
judgment is not what it used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At all events, our place was bought, and we moved out,
well pleased, the first morning in April, not at all remembering
the ill savor of that day for matters of wisdom. Our
place was a pretty cottage, about two miles from the city,
with grounds that had been tastefully laid out. There was
no lack of winding paths, arbors, flower borders, and rosebushes,
with which my wife was especially pleased. There
was a little green lot, strolling off down to a brook, with a
thick grove of trees at the end, where our cow was to be
pastured.</p>
<p>The first week or two went on happily enough in getting
our little new pet of a house into trimness and good order;
for as it had been long for sale, of course there was any
amount of little repairs that had been left to amuse the leisure
hours of the purchaser. Here a doorstep had given way,
and needed replacing; there a shutter hung loose, and wanted
a hinge; abundance of glass needed setting; and as to painting
and papering, there was no end to that. Then my wife
wanted a door cut here, to make our bedroom more convenient,
and a china closet knocked up there, where no china
closet before had been. We even ventured on throwing out
a bay-window from our sitting-room, because we had luckily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_476' name='page_476'></a>476</span>
lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actual
saving of money to employ him. And to be sure our darling
little cottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this
garnishing and furbishing. I got up early every morning,
and nailed up the rosebushes, and my wife got up and watered
geraniums, and both flattered ourselves and each other on our
early hours and thrifty habits. But soon, like Adam and Eve
in Paradise, we found our little domain to ask more hands
than ours to get it into shape. So says I to my wife, &ldquo;I will
bring out a gardener when I come next time, and he shall
lay the garden out, and get it into order; and after that I
can easily keep it by the work of my leisure hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our gardener was a very sublime sort of man,&mdash;an Englishman,
and of course used to laying out noblemen&rsquo;s places,&mdash;and
we became as grasshoppers in our own eyes when he
talked of Lord This and That&rsquo;s estate, and began to question
us about our carriage drive and conservatory; and we could
with difficulty bring the gentleman down to any understanding
of the humble limits of our expectations; merely to dress
out the walks, and lay out a kitchen garden, and plant potatoes,
turnips, beets and carrots, was quite a descent for him.
In fact, so strong were his &aelig;sthetic preferences, that he persuaded
my wife to let him dig all the turf off from a green
square opposite the bay window, and to lay it out into divers
little triangles, resembling small pieces of pie, together with circles,
mounds, and various other geometrical ornaments, the
planning and planting of which soon engrossed my wife&rsquo;s
whole soul. The planting of the potatoes, beets, carrots, etc.,
was intrusted to a raw Irishman; for as to me, to confess the
truth, I began to fear that digging did not agree with me. It
is true that I was exceedingly vigorous at first, and actually
planted with my own hands two or three long rows of potatoes;
after which I got a turn of rheumatism in my shoulder,
which lasted me a week. Stooping down to plant beets and
radishes gave me a vertigo, so that I was obliged to content
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_477' name='page_477'></a>477</span>
myself with a general superintendence of the garden; that is
to say, I charged my Englishman to see that my Irishman did
his duty properly, and then got on to my horse and rode to
the city. But about one part of the matter, I must say, I
was not remiss; and that is, in the purchase of seed and garden
utensils. Not a day passed that I did not come home
with my pockets stuffed with choice seeds, roots, etc.; and
the variety of my garden utensils was unequaled. There
was not a priming hook of any pattern, not a hoe, rake, or
spade great or small, that I did not have specimens of; and
flower seeds and bulbs were also forthcoming in liberal proportions.
In fact, I had opened an account at a thriving
seed store; for when a man is driving business on a large
scale, it is not always convenient to hand out the change for
every little matter, and buying things on account is as neat
and agreeable a mode of acquisition as paying bills with one&rsquo;s
notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we must have a cow,&rdquo; said my wife, the morning
of our second week. Our friend the gardener, who had
now worked with us at the rate of two dollars a day for
two weeks, was at hand in a moment in our emergency.
We wanted to buy a cow, and he had one to sell&mdash;a wonderful
cow, of a real English breed. He would not sell
her for any money, except to oblige particular friends; but
as we had patronized him, we should have her for forty
dollars. How much we were obliged to him! The forty
dollars were speedily forthcoming, and so also was the cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes her shake her head in that way?&rdquo; said my
wife, apprehensively, as she observed the interesting beast
making sundry demonstrations with her horns. &ldquo;I hope
she&rsquo;s gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener fluently demonstrated that the animal was a
pattern of all the softer graces, and that this head-shaking
was merely a little nervous affection consequent on the embarrassment
of a new position. We had faith to believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_478' name='page_478'></a>478</span>
almost anything at this time, and therefore came from the
barn yard to the house as much satisfied with our purchase
as Job with his three thousand camels and five hundred
yoke of oxen. Her quondam master milked her for us the
first evening, out of a delicate regard to her feelings as a
stranger, and we fancied that we discerned forty dollars&rsquo;
worth of excellence in the very quality of the milk.</p>
<p>But alas! the next morning our Irish girl came in with a
most rueful face. &ldquo;And is it milking that baste you&rsquo;d have
me be after?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;sure, and she won&rsquo;t let me come
near her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Biddy!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you frightened her, perhaps;
the cow is perfectly gentle;&rdquo; and with the pail
on my arm I sallied forth. The moment madam saw me
entering the cow yard, she greeted me with a very expressive
flourish of her horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said I, and I stopped. The lady evidently
was serious in her intentions of resisting any personal
approaches. I cut a cudgel, and, putting on a bold face,
marched towards her, while Biddy followed with her milking
stool. Apparently the beast saw the necessity of temporizing,
for she assumed a demure expression, and Biddy
sat down to milk. I stood sentry, and if the lady shook
her head I shook my stick; and thus the milking operation
proceeded with tolerable serenity and success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said I, with dignity, when the frothing pail
was full to the brim. &ldquo;That will do, Biddy,&rdquo; and I
dropped my stick. Dump! came madam&rsquo;s heel on the side
of the pail, and it flew like a rocket into the air, while the
milky flood showered plentifully over me, and a new broadcloth
riding-coat that I had assumed for the first time that
morning. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said I, as soon as I could get my
breath from this extraordinary shower bath; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s all
this?&rdquo; My wife came running towards the cow yard, as I
stood with the milk streaming from my hair, filling my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_479' name='page_479'></a>479</span>
eyes, and dropping from the tip of my nose; and she and
Biddy performed a recitative lamentation over me in alternate
strophes, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy. Such
was our first morning&rsquo;s experience; but as we had announced
our bargain with some considerable flourish of
trumpets among our neighbors and friends, we concluded
to hush the matter up as much as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These very superior cows are apt to be cross,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;we must bear with it as we do with the eccentricities of
genius; besides, when she gets accustomed to us, it will be
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madam was therefore installed into her pretty pasture lot,
and my wife contemplated with pleasure the picturesque
effect of her appearance, reclining on the green slope of the
pasture lot, or standing ankle deep in the gurgling brook,
or reclining under the deep shadows of the trees. She was,
in fact, a handsome cow, which may account, in part, for
some of her sins; and this consideration inspired me with
some degree of indulgence towards her foibles.</p>
<p>But when I found that Biddy could never succeed in
getting near her in the pasture, and that any kind of success
in the milking operations required my vigorous personal
exertions morning and evening, the matter wore a more
serious aspect, and I began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive.
It is very well to talk of the pleasures of the
milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple
dawn; but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a
drizzly, rainy morning, and equipping himself for a scamper
through a wet pasture lot, rope in hand, at the heels of
such a termagant as mine! In fact, madam established a
regular series of exercises, which had all to be gone through
before she would suffer herself to be captured; as, first, she
would station herself plump in the middle of a marsh, which
lay at the lower part of the lot, and look very innocent and
absent-minded, as if reflecting on some sentimental subject.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_480' name='page_480'></a>480</span>
&ldquo;Suke! Suke! Suke!&rdquo; I ejaculate, cautiously tottering
along the edge of the marsh, and holding out an ear of corn.
The lady looks gracious, and comes forward, almost within
reach of my hand. I make a plunge to throw the rope
over her horns, and away she goes, kicking up mud and
water into my face in her flight, while I, losing my balance,
tumble forward into the marsh. I pick myself up, and,
full of wrath, behold her placidly chewing her cud on the
other side, with the meekest air imaginable, as who should
say, &ldquo;I hope you are not hurt, sir.&rdquo; I dash through swamp
and bog furiously, resolving to carry all by a <i>coup de main</i>.
Then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging, scampering,
and bopeeping, among the trees of the grove, interspersed
with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid. I
always wondered how I caught her every day; and when
I had tied her head to one post and her heels to another, I
wiped the sweat from my brow, and thought I was paying
dear for the eccentricities of genius. A genius she certainly
was, for besides her surprising agility, she had other talents
equally extraordinary. There was no fence that she could
not take down; nowhere that she could not go. She took
the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure, using her
horns as handily as I could use a claw hammer. Whatever
she had a mind to, whether it were a bite in the cabbage
garden, or a run in the corn patch, or a foraging expedition
into the flower borders, she made herself equally welcome
and at home. Such a scampering and driving, such cries
of &ldquo;Suke here&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suke there,&rdquo; as constantly greeted
our ears, kept our little establishment in a constant commotion.
At last, when she one morning made a plunge at the
skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat, and carried off one
flap on her horns, my patience gave out, and I determined
to sell her.</p>
<p>As, however, I had made a good story of my misfortunes
among my friends and neighbors, and amused them with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_481' name='page_481'></a>481</span>
sundry whimsical accounts of my various adventures in the
cow-catching line, I found, when I came to speak of selling,
that there was a general coolness on the subject, and nobody
seemed disposed to be the recipient of my responsibilities.
In short, I was glad, at last, to get fifteen dollars for her,
and comforted myself with thinking that I had at least
gained twenty-five dollars worth of experience in the transaction,
to say nothing of the fine exercise.</p>
<p>I comforted my soul, however, the day after, by purchasing
and bringing home to my wife a fine swarm of bees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bee, now,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is a really classical insect,
and breathes of Virgil and the Augustan age,&mdash;and then
she is a domestic, tranquil, placid creature. How beautiful
the murmuring of a hive near our honeysuckle of a calm,
summer evening! Then they are tranquilly and peacefully
amassing for us their stores of sweetness, while they lull us
with their murmurs. What a beautiful image of disinterested
benevolence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife declared that I was quite a poet, and the beehive
was duly installed near the flower plots, that the delicate
creatures might have the full benefit of the honeysuckle
and mignonette. My spirits began to rise. I bought three
different treatises on the rearing of bees, and also one or
two new patterns of hives, and proposed to rear my bees on
the most approved model. I charged all the establishment
to let me know when there was any indication of an emigrating
spirit, that I might be ready to receive the new
swarm into my patent mansion.</p>
<p>Accordingly, one afternoon, when I was deep in an article
that I was preparing for the &ldquo;North American Review,&rdquo; intelligence
was brought me that a swarm had risen. I was
on the alert at once, and discovered, on going out, that the
provoking creatures had chosen the top of a tree about thirty
feet high to settle on. Now my books had carefully instructed
me just how to approach the swarm and cover them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_482' name='page_482'></a>482</span>
with a new hive; but I had never contemplated the possibility
of the swarm being, like Haman&rsquo;s gallows, forty
cubits high. I looked despairingly upon the smooth-bark
tree, which rose, like a column, full twenty feet, without
branch or twig. &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said I, appealing
to two or three neighbors. At last, at the recommendation
of one of them, a ladder was raised against the tree, and,
equipped with a shirt outside of my clothes, a green veil
over my head, and a pair of leather gloves on my hands, I
went up with a saw at my girdle to saw off the branch on
which they had settled, and lower it by a rope to a neighbor,
similarly equipped, who stood below with the hive.</p>
<p>As a result of this man&oelig;uvre the fastidious little insects
were at length fairly installed at housekeeping in my new
patent hive, and, rejoicing in my success, I again sat down
to my article.</p>
<p>That evening my wife and I took tea in our honeysuckle
arbor, with our little ones and a friend or two, to whom I
showed my treasures, and expatiated at large on the comforts
and conveniences of the new patent hive.</p>
<p>But alas for the hopes of man! The little ungrateful
wretches&mdash;what must they do but take advantage of my
oversleeping myself, the next morning, to clear out for new
quarters without so much as leaving me a P. P. C.! Such
was the fact; at eight o&rsquo;clock I found the new patent hive
as good as ever; but the bees I have never seen from that
day to this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rascally little conservatives!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I believe
they have never had a new idea from the days of Virgil
down, and are entirely unprepared to appreciate improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the seeds began to germinate in our garden,
when we found, to our chagrin, that, between John Bull
and Paddy, there had occurred sundry confusions in the
several departments. Radishes had been planted broadcast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_483' name='page_483'></a>483</span>
carrots and beets arranged in hills, and here and there a
whole paper of seed appeared to have been planted bodily.
My good old uncle, who, somewhat to my confusion, made
me a call at this time, was greatly distressed and scandalized
by the appearance of our garden. But by a deal of fussing,
transplanting, and replanting, it was got into some shape
and order. My uncle was rather troublesome, as careful
old people are apt to be&mdash;annoying us by perpetual inquiries
of what we gave for this and that, and running up provoking
calculations on the final cost of matters; and we
began to wish that his visits might be as short as would be
convenient.</p>
<p>But when, on taking leave, he promised to send us a fine
young cow of his own raising, our hearts rather smote us
for our impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t any of your new breeds, nephew,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;yet I can say that she&rsquo;s a gentle, likely young crittur,
and better worth forty dollars than many a one that&rsquo;s
cried up for Ayrshire or Durham; and you shall be quite
welcome to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked him, as in duty bound, and thought that if
he was full of old-fashioned notions, he was no less full of
kindness and good will.</p>
<p>And now, with a new cow, with our garden beginning to
thrive under the gentle showers of May, with our flower
borders blooming, my wife and I began to think ourselves
in Paradise. But alas! the same sun and rain that warmed
our fruit and flowers brought up from the earth, like sulky
gnomes, a vast array of purple-leaved weeds, that almost in
a night seemed to cover the whole surface of the garden
beds. Our gardeners both being gone, the weeding was
expected to be done by me&mdash;one of the anticipated relaxations
of my leisure hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, in reply to a gentle intimation from my
wife, &ldquo;when my article is finished, I&rsquo;ll take a day and
weed all up clean.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_484' name='page_484'></a>484</span></div>
<p>Thus days slipped by, till at length the article was
dispatched, and I proceeded to my garden. Amazement!
Who could have possibly foreseen that anything earthly
could grow so fast in a few days! There were no bounds,
no alleys, no beds, no distinction of beet and carrot, nothing
but a flourishing congregation of weeds nodding and bobbing
in the morning breeze, as if to say, &ldquo;We hope you are well,
sir&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got the ground, you see!&rdquo; I began to explore,
and to hoe, and to weed. Ah! did anybody ever try to
clean a neglected carrot or beet bed, or bend his back in a
hot sun over rows of weedy onions! He is the man to feel
for my despair! How I weeded, and sweat, and sighed!
till, when high noon came on, as the result of all my toils,
only three beds were cleaned! And how disconsolate looked
the good seed, thus unexpectedly delivered from its sheltering
tares, and laid open to a broiling July sun! Every
juvenile beet and carrot lay flat down wilted, and drooping,
as if, like me, they had been weeding, instead of being
weeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This weeding is quite a serious matter,&rdquo; said I to my
wife; &ldquo;the fact is, I must have help about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was myself thinking,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;My
flower borders are all in confusion, and my petunia mounds
so completely overgrown, that nobody would dream what
they were meant for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, it was agreed between us that we could not
afford the expense of a full-grown man to keep our place;
yet we must reinforce ourselves by the addition of a boy,
and a brisk youngster from the vicinity was pitched upon
as the happy addition. This youth was a fellow of decidedly
quick parts, and in one forenoon made such a clearing
in our garden that I was delighted. Bed after bed appeared
to view, all cleared and dressed out with such celerity that
I was quite ashamed of my own slowness, until, on examination,
I discovered that he had, with great impartiality,
pulled up both weeds and vegetables.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_485' name='page_485'></a>485</span></div>
<p>This hopeful beginning was followed up by a succession
of proceedings which should be recorded for the instruction
of all who seek for help from the race of boys. Such a
loser of all tools, great and small; such an invariable leaver-open
of all gates, and letter-down of bars; such a personification
of all manner of anarchy and ill luck, had never
before been seen on the estate. His time, while I was gone
to the city, was agreeably diversified with roosting on the
fence, swinging on the gates, making poplar whistles for
the children, hunting eggs, and eating whatever fruit happened
to be in season, in which latter accomplishment
he was certainly quite distinguished. After about three
weeks of this kind of joint gardening, we concluded to dismiss
Master Tom from the firm, and employ a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things must be taken care of,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I cannot
do it. &rsquo;Tis out of the question.&rdquo; And so the man was
secured.</p>
<p>But I am making a long story, and may chance to outrun
the sympathies of my readers. Time would fail me to tell
of the distresses manifold that fell upon me&mdash;of cows dried
up by poor milkers; of hens that wouldn&rsquo;t set at all, and
hens that, despite all law and reason, would set on one egg;
of hens that, having hatched families, straightway led them
into all manner of high grass and weeds, by which means
numerous young chicks caught premature colds and perished;
and how, when I, with manifold toil, had driven one of these
inconsiderate gadders into a coop, to teach her domestic habits,
the rats came down upon her and slew every chick in
one night; how my pigs were always practicing gymnastic
exercises over the fence of the sty, and marauding in the
garden. I wonder that Fourier never conceived the idea
of having his garden land ploughed by pigs; for certainly
they manifest quite a decided elective attraction for turning
up the earth.</p>
<p>When autumn came, I went soberly to market, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_486' name='page_486'></a>486</span>
neighboring city, and bought my potatoes and turnips like
any other man; for, between all the various systems of
gardening pursued, I was obliged to confess that my first
horticultural effort was a decided failure. But though all
my rural visions had proved illusive, there were some very
substantial realities. My bill at the seed store, for seeds,
roots, and tools, for example, had run up to an amount
that was perfectly unaccountable; then there were various
smaller items, such as horseshoeing, carriage mending&mdash;for
he who lives in the country and does business in the city
must keep his vehicle and appurtenances. I had always
prided myself on being an exact man, and settling every
account, great and small, with the going out of the old year;
but this season I found myself sorely put to it. In fact,
had not I received a timely lift from my good old uncle,
I should have made a complete break down. The old gentleman&rsquo;s
troublesome habit of ciphering and calculating, it
seems, had led him beforehand to foresee that I was not exactly
in the money-making line, nor likely to possess much
surplus revenue to meet the note which I had given for
my place; and, therefore, he quietly paid it himself, as I
discovered, when, after much anxiety and some sleepless
nights, I went to the holder to ask for an extension of
credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was right, after all,&rdquo; said I to my wife; &ldquo;&lsquo;to live
cheap in the country, a body must know how.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>TRIALS OF A HOUSEKEEPER</h2>
</div>
<p>I have a detail of very homely grievances to present;
but such as they are, many a heart will feel them to be
heavy&mdash;the trials of a housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poh!&rdquo; says one of the lords of creation, taking his
cigar out of his mouth, and twirling it between his two first
fingers, &ldquo;what a fuss these women do make of this simple
matter of managing a family! I can&rsquo;t see for my life as
there is anything so extraordinary to be done in this matter
of housekeeping: only three meals a day to be got and cleared
off&mdash;and it really seems to take up the whole of their mind
from morning till night. <i>I</i> could keep house without so
much of a flurry, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, prithee, good brother, listen to my story, and see
how much you know about it. I came to this enlightened
West about a year since, and was duly established in a comfortable
country residence within a mile and a half of the
city, and there commenced the enjoyment of domestic felicity.
I had been married about three months, and had
been, previously <i>in love</i> in the most approved romantic way,
with all the proprieties of moonlight walks, serenades, sentimental
billets doux, and everlasting attachment.</p>
<p>After having been allowed, as I said, about three months
to get over this sort of thing, and to prepare for realities, I
was located for life as aforesaid. My family consisted of
myself and husband, a female friend as a visitor, and two
brothers of my good man, who were engaged with him in
business.</p>
<p>I pass over the first two or three days, spent in that process
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_488' name='page_488'></a>488</span>
of hammering boxes, breaking crockery, knocking things
down and picking them up again, which is commonly called
getting to housekeeping. As usual, carpets were sewed and
stretched, laid down, and taken up to be sewed over; things
were formed, and <i>re</i>formed, <i>trans</i>formed, and <i>con</i>formed,
till at last a settled order began to appear. But now came
up the great point of all. During our confusion we had
cooked and eaten our meals in a very miscellaneous and pastoral
manner, eating now from the top of a barrel, and now
from a fireboard laid on two chairs, and drinking, some from
teacups, and some from saucers, and some from tumblers,
and some from a pitcher big enough to be drowned in, and
sleeping, some on sofas, and some on straggling beds and
mattresses thrown down here and there wherever there was
room. All these pleasant barbarities were now at an end.
The house was in order, the dishes put up in their places;
three regular meals were to be administered in one day, all
in an orderly, civilized form; beds were to be made, rooms
swept and dusted, dishes washed, knives scoured, and all the
et cetera to be attended to. Now for getting &ldquo;help,&rdquo; as
Mrs. Trollope says; and where and how were we to get it?
We knew very few persons in the city; and how were we
to accomplish the matter? At length the &ldquo;house of employment&rdquo;
was mentioned; and my husband was dispatched
thither regularly every day for a week, while I, in the mean
time, was very nearly <i>dispatched</i> by the abundance of work
at home. At length, one evening, as I was sitting completely
exhausted, thinking of resorting to the last feminine
expedient for supporting life, viz., a good fit of crying, my
husband made his appearance, with a most triumphant air,
at the door. &ldquo;There, Margaret, I have got you a couple at
last&mdash;cook and chambermaid.&rdquo; So saying, he flourished
open the door, and gave to my view the picture of a little,
dry, snuffy-looking old woman, and a great, staring Dutch
girl, in a green bonnet with red ribbons, with mouth wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_489' name='page_489'></a>489</span>
open, and hands and feet that would have made a Greek
sculptor open <i>his</i> mouth too. I addressed forthwith a few
words of encouragement to each of this cultivated-looking
couple, and proceeded to ask their names; and forthwith
the old woman began to snuffle and to wipe her face with
what was left of an old silk pocket-handkerchief preparatory
to speaking, while the young lady opened her mouth wider,
and looked around with a frightened air, as if meditating
an escape. After some preliminaries, however, I found out
that my old woman was Mrs. Tibbins, and my Hebe&rsquo;s name
was <i>Kotterin</i>; also, that she knew much more Dutch than
English, and not any too much of either. The old lady was
the cook. I ventured a few inquiries. &ldquo;Had she ever
cooked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, sartain; she had lived at two or three places
in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect, my dear,&rdquo; said my husband confidently, &ldquo;that
she is an experienced cook, and so your troubles are over;&rdquo;
and he went to reading his newspaper. I said no more, but
determined to wait till morning. The breakfast, to be sure,
did not do much honor to the talents of my official; but it
was the first time, and the place was new to her. After
breakfast was cleared away I proceeded to give directions for
dinner; it was merely a plain joint of meat, I said, to be
roasted in the tin oven. The experienced cook looked at
me with a stare of entire vacuity. &ldquo;The tin oven,&rdquo; I repeated,
&ldquo;stands there,&rdquo; pointing to it.</p>
<p>She walked up to it, and touched it with such an appearance
of suspicion as if it had been an electrical battery, and
then looked round at me with a look of such helpless ignorance
that my soul was moved. &ldquo;I never see one of them
things before,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw a tin oven!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought
you said you had cooked in two or three families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They does not have such things as them, though,&rdquo; rejoined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_490' name='page_490'></a>490</span>
my old lady. Nothing was to be done, of course, but
to instruct her into the philosophy of the case; and having
spitted the joint, and given numberless directions, I walked
off to my room to superintend the operations of Kotterin,
to whom I had committed the making of my bed and the
sweeping of my room, it never having come into my head
that there could be a wrong way of making a bed; and to
this day it is a marvel to me how any one could arrange
pillows and quilts to make such a nondescript appearance as
mine now presented. One glance showed me that Kotterin
also was &ldquo;<i>just caught</i>,&rdquo; and that I had as much to do in
her department as in that of my old lady.</p>
<p>Just then the doorbell rang. &ldquo;Oh, there is the doorbell,&rdquo;
I exclaimed. &ldquo;Run, Kotterin, and show them into
the parlor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kotterin started to run, as directed, and then stopped,
and stood looking round on all the doors and on me with a
wofully puzzled air. &ldquo;The street door,&rdquo; said I, pointing
towards the entry. Kotterin blundered into the entry, and
stood gazing with a look of stupid wonder at the bell ringing
without hands, while I went to the door and let in
the company before she could be fairly made to understand
the connection between the ringing and the phenomenon of
admission.</p>
<p>As dinner time approached, I sent word into my kitchen
to have it set on; but recollecting the state of the heads
of department there, I soon followed my own orders. I
found the tin oven standing out in the middle of the kitchen,
and my cook seated <i>à la Turc</i> in front of it, contemplating
the roast meat with full as puzzled an air as in the
morning. I once more explained the mystery of taking it
off, and assisted her to get it on to the platter, though somewhat
cooled by having been so long set out for inspection.
I was standing holding the spit in my hands, when Kotterin,
who had heard the doorbell ring, and was determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_491' name='page_491'></a>491</span>
this time to be in season, ran into the hall, and, soon
returning, opened the kitchen door, and politely ushered in
three or four fashionable looking ladies, exclaiming, &ldquo;Here
she is.&rdquo; As these were strangers from the city, who had
come to make their first call, this introduction was far from
proving an eligible one&mdash;the look of thunderstruck astonishment
with which I greeted their first appearance, as I
stood brandishing the spit, and the terrified snuffling and
staring of poor Mrs. Tibbins, who again had recourse to her
old pocket-handkerchief, almost entirely vanquished their
gravity, and it was evident that they were on the point of
a broad laugh; so, recovering my self-possession, I apologized,
and led the way to the parlor.</p>
<p>Let these few incidents be a specimen of the four mortal
weeks that I spent with these &ldquo;helps,&rdquo; during which time
I did almost as much work, with twice as much anxiety, as
when there was nobody there; and yet everything went
wrong besides. The young gentlemen complained of the
patches of starch grimed to their collars, and the streaks of
black coal ironed into their dickies, while one week every
pocket-handkerchief in the house was starched so stiff that
you might as well have carried an earthen plate in your
pocket; the tumblers looked muddy; the plates were never
washed clean or wiped dry unless I attended to each one;
and as to eating and drinking, we experienced a variety
that we had not before considered possible.</p>
<p>At length the old woman vanished from the stage, and
was succeeded by a knowing, active, capable damsel, with a
temper like a steel-trap, who remained with me just one
week, and then went off in a fit of spite. To her succeeded
a rosy, good-natured, merry lass, who broke the crockery,
burned the dinner, tore the clothes in ironing, and knocked
down everything that stood in her way about the house,
without at all discomposing herself about the matter. One
night she took the stopper from a barrel of molasses, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_492' name='page_492'></a>492</span>
came singing off upstairs, while the molasses ran soberly
out into the cellar bottom all night, till by morning it was
in a state of universal emancipation. Having done this,
and also dispatched an entire set of tea things by letting
the waiter fall, she one day made her disappearance.</p>
<p>Then, for a wonder, there fell to my lot a tidy, efficient,
trained English girl; pretty, and genteel, and neat, and
knowing how to do everything, and with the sweetest temper
in the world. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;I shall rest
from my labors.&rdquo; Everything about the house began to
go right, and looked as clean and genteel as Mary&rsquo;s own
pretty self. But, alas! this period of repose was interrupted
by the vision of a clever, trim-looking young man,
who for some weeks could be heard scraping his boots at
the kitchen door every Sunday night; and at last Miss
Mary, with some smiling and blushing, gave me to understand
that she must leave in two weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary,&rdquo; said I, feeling a little mischievous,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you like the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you look for another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to another place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Mary, are you going to learn a trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, what do you mean to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to keep house myself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she, laughing
and blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is it;&rdquo; and so in two weeks
I lost the best little girl in the world: peace to her memory.</p>
<p>After this came an interregnum, which put me in mind
of the chapter in Chronicles that I used to read with great
delight when a child, where Basha, and Elah, and Tibni,
and Zimri, and Omri, one after the other, came on to the
throne of Israel, all in the compass of half a dozen verses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_493' name='page_493'></a>493</span>
We had one old woman, who stayed a week, and went away
with the misery in her tooth; one young woman, who ran
away and got married; one cook, who came at night and
went off before light in the morning; one very clever girl,
who stayed a month, and then went away because her mother
was sick; another, who stayed six weeks, and was taken with
the fever herself; and during all this time, who can speak
the damage and destruction wrought in the domestic paraphernalia
by passing through these multiplied hands?</p>
<p>What shall we do? Shall we give up houses, have no
furniture to take care of, keep merely a bag of meal, a porridge
pot, and a pudding stick, and sit in our tent door in
real patriarchal independence? What shall we do?</p>
